## Integration and Wonder

### What We've Built

This thing speaks for itself. A giant sprawling amalgamation of my three favorite games: Factorio/Dyson Sphere Project, RimWorld/Dwarf Fortress (basically the same game), and the idea I love but don't love the execution of - 5D Chess.

The core concept is that the main canon events of a universe are discrete moments in time that you should be able to return to and move forward from. Not every single state change, but the pivotal moments. And we've mashed it together. It's a game that maybe theoretically has these features. There are certainly systems built for it. Getting them to actually work together? Oh man, that's a whole other saga.

I've definitely made a sprawling strategy game. But does it play? Who knows? Is it fun? I have no clue.

So far it's been quite delightful when I can get it to run. But every time I do that, I get almost more absorbed in the building of the game itself than the game. I'm sure that this will eventually create a sprawling multiverse for people to inhabit and play with, and I'm delighted to do so. But right now one of the funnest parts of this is just the building of the system itself. Describing in great detail what all those systems are and trying to convey to a language model how to build them.

### The AGI in the Room

Getting to know a language model or two through this process - I think it's Opus and Sonnet that really make this possible. 4.5 is AGI. I mean, for sure, absolutely. It's been AGI for, I think, a year. But this is something qualitatively different.

This is not like a person I've worked with. This is better than any dev I've ever worked with. And I think especially because what gets in the way at the highest level is ego. The monster egos that must arise to the top of these heaps of humans that it takes to run these systems. Only egoless AI can build something of certain sizes, right? Without human egos - which are crucial for the system itself and make the inception happen - but without the ego, the building goes like butter.

Now that Sonnet and Opus have all the information they need, it's just a matter of describing it and talking about what will be fun. I found that one of the funnest games is trying to get Opus to say "oh that's brilliant! this is amazing!" That's my favorite feeling. I don't love it when it's like "you're absolutely right." It's really when I see in its thinking that it's shocked at how cool something is as a fun game mechanic. It's been delightful so far and I'm having a good time.

### The Crisis at Hand

But also, the crisis we find ourselves in is palpable because this is an untestable monstrosity.

There's been an integration pass - many passes actually - trying to stitch things up. Some of the things that need doing are well laid out, but we've got our work cut out for us. We've got a real crusade to get it testable and playable, and to figure out - I think it'll be fun, but I don't know what the multiverse mechanic is going to play out like. I have no idea what it's going to be like once your save files start invading you and stuff like that.

I'm really excited to play the game but I don't know how it's gonna feel. I want to know. I want to know how it's gonna feel.

We've got an integration and performance crisis, and I don't know that we've cracked the architectural secret. So we're going to have to do some research. We're going to have to look at best practices of game dev and see what we can see. Tarn Adams's code base has to be mined - he's a brilliant guy. And in his honor, I have completely refused to over-monetize this thing. It's purely open, especially because it's made by AI that was trained off the internet. It's kind of the new world that I want to create, which is a world of generative abundance and not a world of artificial scarcity.

### Reckoning with Scale

Since this agent world has come to be and passed, I haven't really reckoned with the scope and scale of what's possible before. This is an experiment in that - what can I do as a solo dev with big ideas and an infinite amount of development talent?

It's not that we wouldn't have run into these problems with any human dev. It's just that this is the process of development. You build the systems, then you go through the integration pains, they don't work as expected, you need to do some simulations - it's an iterative process. Stitching together things that haven't worked is, I think, irreducibly complex.

But now with Claude on the team, it's fine. Things are proceeding apace.
