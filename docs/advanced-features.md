## Magic System

The magic system features 25+ distinct paradigms, each with unique mechanics and flavor.

### How Magic Works

**Magic in this game is:**
- **Skill-based** - Agents learn paradigms through practice and study
- **Composable** - Combine verbs (Create, Destroy, Transform) with nouns (Fire, Water, Earth)
- **Simulated** - Spells have real effects tested in the game world
- **Limited by skill** - Higher skill = more powerful spells
- **Universe-specific** - Each universe can have different magic rules

### Magic Paradigms (Selected Examples)

**Elemental Magic**
- Control fire, water, earth, air
- Classic fantasy spellcasting
- Effects: Fireballs, water summoning, earth walls, wind gusts
- Good for: Combat, environmental manipulation

**Sympathy** (Inspired by Kingkiller Chronicle)
- Magic through connections and true names
- Link similar objects to affect them at a distance
- Powerful but requires knowledge of target
- Good for: Remote effects, binding magic

**Allomancy** (Inspired by Mistborn)
- Consume and "burn" metals for specific powers
- Each metal grants a different ability
- Resource-limited (need metals)
- Good for: Physical enhancement, metal manipulation

**Shinto Spirit Magic**
- Bargain with nature spirits (kami)
- Respectful, relationship-based
- Effects: Blessings, spirit guardians, nature harmony
- Good for: Agriculture, diplomacy, protection

**Divine Channeling**
- Channel power from deities
- Requires faith and prayer
- Gods may grant or deny requests
- Good for: Healing, blessings, miracles

**Necromancy**
- Communicate with and command the dead
- Access soul realm
- Powerful but often has costs
- Good for: Information, undead servants, soul magic

**Alchemy**
- Transform materials and brew potions
- Crafting-focused magic
- Creates consumable magic items
- Good for: Economy, support, preparation

**Plus 18+ more paradigms** including: Technomancy, Blood Magic, Chronomancy, Runic Magic, Psionics, and experimental paradigms.

### Learning Magic

**Agents learn magic by:**
1. **Discovery** - Finding magic sources in the world
2. **Teaching** - Learning from other mages
3. **Research** - Studying magic at research stations
4. **Practice** - Casting spells to gain XP
5. **Divine gifts** - Gods granting magical knowledge

**Skill Tree:**
- Open Magic Skill Tree Panel (M key) when agent selected
- See visual tree of available spells
- Prerequisites shown (must learn basic spells first)
- XP costs displayed
- Unlock spells by spending XP

### Casting Spells

**Automatic casting:**
- Agents autonomously cast spells when useful
- Consider: Situation, mana cost, skill level, goals
- Examples: Fire mage casting fireball in combat, healer casting heal on injured ally

**Manual casting (advanced):**
- Select agent with magic skills
- Open Spellbook Panel
- Choose spell to cast
- Target location or entity

**Spell Composition:**
- Some paradigms allow verb+noun composition
- Example: Create + Fire = Fireball
- Example: Destroy + Earth = Earthquake
- Endless combinations possible

### Magic Tips

- **Start with one paradigm** - Master one before adding more
- **Match paradigm to agent personality** - Peaceful agents → healing, aggressive → combat
- **Build research facilities** - Speed up magic discovery
- **Watch for mana** - Agents need mana to cast (regenerates over time)
- **Experiment!** - Try combinations, see what works in simulation

## Divinity System

Gods, faith, temples, and divine intervention create a rich religious layer.

### How Gods Emerge

**Gods aren't created by you - they emerge from belief:**

1. **Agents start believing** in concepts (sun, harvest, death, etc.)
2. **Belief accumulates** in domains
3. **God spontaneously emerges** when belief reaches threshold
4. **God develops personality** based on believers and domain
5. **God gains power** from ongoing worship

### God Attributes

Each god has:
- **Domain(s)** - Sun, Death, Harvest, War, Love, etc.
- **Personality** - Benevolent, wrathful, capricious, wise
- **Power level** - Based on believer count and faith strength
- **Relationships** - With other gods (pantheon politics!)
- **Myths** - Stories that spread among believers

### Divine Interactions

**Prayer:**
- Agents pray autonomously when in need
- Prayers request: Healing, protection, good harvest, victory
- Gods may answer based on: Prayer quality, relationship with agent, current mood, available power

**Blessings:**
- Temporary positive effects
- Examples: Increased crop yield, protection in battle, skill boost
- Last hours to days
- Can stack from multiple gods

**Curses:**
- Negative effects from displeased gods
- Causes: Blasphemy, neglect, breaking divine law
- Examples: Bad luck, crop failure, injury
- Can be lifted through atonement

**Visions:**
- Gods send dreams and visions to agents
- Contain: Guidance, warnings, requests
- Agents may share visions with others
- Can influence agent behavior significantly

**Miracles:**
- Direct divine intervention

## Automation and Factories

Build complex production chains for resource automation.

### Power Grid

**Energy generation and distribution:**
- **Generators:** Wind, water, solar, fuel-burning
- **Power lines:** Connect buildings
- **Power consumption:** Machines need energy
- **Grid management:** Balance production and use

### Conveyor Belts

**Item transport system:**
- Place belts in world
- Items automatically move along belt
- Connect: Resource → Processing → Storage
- Speed depends on power
- Enables: Hands-free logistics

### Assembly Machines

**Automated crafting:**
- Set recipe (e.g., "Wood → Planks")
- Machine pulls ingredients from input
- Processes over time
- Outputs to conveyor or storage
- Requires: Power, maintenance

### Factory Layout

**Building an automated factory:**
1. **Resource extraction:** Agents or machines gather raw materials
2. **Transport:** Conveyors move materials to processors
3. **Processing:** Assembly machines craft items
4. **Storage:** Output warehouses
5. **Distribution:** Conveyors to where items are needed

**Example: Automated Food Production**
```
Farm (wheat) → Conveyor → Mill (flour) → Conveyor → Oven (bread) → Storage
```

**Advantages:**
- Frees agents from repetitive tasks
- Scales production massively
- Enables complex recipes
- Runs 24/7 without agent intervention

**Challenges:**
- Requires significant resources to build
- Power management complexity
- Maintenance needed
- Initial setup time
