# Multiverse: The End of Eternity - Player Guides

Welcome to **Multiverse: The End of Eternity**! This is a simulation game where autonomous AI agents live, work, build, and surprise you with their emergent behavior.

## What This Game Is

This isn't a traditional game where you control everything. Instead, you're observing (and occasionally nudging) a living, breathing simulation where:

- **Agents make their own decisions** - They eat, sleep, work, socialize, and pursue goals without your input
- **The world keeps running** - Even when you're not looking, agents continue building their community
- **Emergent stories unfold** - Complex behaviors emerge from simple rules interacting
- **Magic and gods are real** - Agents can learn magic, worship deities, and experience divine intervention
- **Death isn't the end** - Souls persist, get judged, and can be reincarnated

Think of it as a cross between The Sims, Dwarf Fortress, and RimWorld, but with agents that surprise you with genuinely novel behavior.

## What Makes This Special

### Deep Simulation
The game simulates everything from soil pH to divine intervention. Agents have:
- **Physical needs** (hunger, energy, cleanliness, temperature comfort)
- **Emotional states** (mood, social fulfillment)
- **Memories** that influence future decisions
- **Skills** that improve with practice
- **Relationships** with other agents and even gods

### Magic System
Over 25 different magic paradigms, from elemental magic to sympathy to divine channeling. Agents can learn spells, combine magical effects, and even create new magic through experimentation.

### Divinity and Faith
Gods emerge from collective belief. Agents can pray, build temples, become priests, and receive visions. Gods have personalities, domains, and can grant blessings or curses.

### Conservation of Game Matter
Nothing is ever truly deleted. Souls persist across deaths and reincarnations. Items can be recovered. Even corrupted data is preserved for potential recovery. Your village's history is permanent.

### Environmental Depth
- Realistic fire propagation that spreads based on materials and wind
- Ocean ecosystems with depth-based creatures and bioluminescence
- Weather systems affecting agent behavior
- Biome transitions with smooth terrain blending
