NEEDS_WORK: resource-gathering

=== PLAYTEST VERDICT ===

Feature: Resource Gathering (Phase 7)
Status: NEEDS_WORK ❌
Date: 2025-12-22
Playtest Agent: playtest-agent-001

=== CRITICAL FINDINGS ===

✅ GOOD NEWS: Wood gathering IS working at the system level
- Console logs confirm agents successfully harvest wood (5-10 wood per action)
- Agents autonomously enter gather behavior
- Multiple agents can gather simultaneously
- AI decision-making is functional

❌ BLOCKING ISSUE: NO INVENTORY UI
- Agent info panel completely lacks inventory display
- Cannot see what resources agents have collected
- Cannot verify if inventory component exists
- Players have ZERO visibility into gathered resources

❌ Stone gathering not observed
- Only wood gathering occurred during 10+ minutes of testing
- No mine actions in console logs
- Cannot verify if stone mining is implemented

⚠️ Cannot test 4 out of 7 acceptance criteria due to missing UI

=== ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA RESULTS ===

1. InventoryComponent Creation: INCONCLUSIVE ⚠️ (no UI to verify)
2. Wood Gathering (Chop): PARTIAL PASS ✅/❌ (works in code, no UI)
3. Stone Gathering (Mine): FAIL ❌ (not observed)
4. Resource Transfer for Construction: INCONCLUSIVE ⚠️ (cannot verify)
5. Resource Regeneration: INCONCLUSIVE ⚠️ (cannot observe)
6. Inventory Weight Limit: INCONCLUSIVE ⚠️ (cannot test)
7. Gather Behavior: PASS ✅ (fully functional)

Overall: 1/7 fully passed, 1/7 partial, 1/7 failed, 4/7 inconclusive

=== WHAT MUST BE FIXED ===

Priority 1 (CRITICAL - BLOCKING):
1. Implement inventory display UI in agent info panel
   - Show slots with items and quantities
   - Display current/max weight
   - Real-time updates as agents gather

Priority 2 (HIGH):
2. Verify stone gathering works (or implement it)
3. Fix resource count displays (still show 100/100 after harvesting)

Priority 3 (MEDIUM):
4. Add visual feedback for gathering (animations, particles)
5. Enable building placement testing

- agent-selected.png (shows NO inventory section)

Console logs captured showing successful wood harvesting:
[AISystem.gatherBehavior] Agent d559f125... harvesting 7 wood from e0...
[AISystem.gatherBehavior] Agent 092f9391... harvesting 5 wood from e0...
[AISystem.gatherBehavior] Agent aabc78dc... harvesting 9 wood from 3c...

=== CONCLUSION ===

The IMPLEMENTATION appears functional, but it's INVISIBLE to players.
Cannot approve for human review until inventory UI is added.

Returning to Implementation Agent for UI work.
