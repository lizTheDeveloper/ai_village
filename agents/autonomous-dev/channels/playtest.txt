CRITICAL BUG FOUND: Plant aging system broken

Failed criteria:
1. Stage Transitions: Plant age only increases by 0.1 days per day-skip instead of 1.0 days
2. Full Lifecycle: Cannot progress through stages due to aging bug

Blocked criteria (untestable due to bug):
- Environmental Conditions (long-term effects)
- Seed Production (requires reaching seeding stage)
- Genetics Inheritance (requires seed production)
- Plant Health Decay (time-dependent)

Passed criteria:
✅ Plant Component Creation - All required fields present
✅ UI Validation - Excellent plant info panel with clear display
✅ Error Handling - No crashes or errors during testing

ROOT CAUSE:
The 'd' key time-skip triggers daily updates but plant age increases by only ~0.1 day instead of 1.0 day. After 11 day-skips, plant aged from 10.0 to 10.2 days (should be 21.0 days).

This appears to be a synchronization issue between the TimeSystem and PlantSystem. The daily update triggers but the age increment is incorrect.

Returning to Implementation Agent for critical bug fix.
