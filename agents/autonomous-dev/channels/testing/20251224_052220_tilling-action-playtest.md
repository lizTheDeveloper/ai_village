NEEDS_WORK: tilling-action

Failed criteria:
1. Criterion 8 (Visual Feedback): Tilled tiles have NO visual distinction on game map - cannot identify tilled vs untilled tiles without clicking inspector panel
2. UI shows correct data (inspector panel excellent) but game world rendering shows no change

Core tilling works (terrain changes, fertility sets, plantability initializes), error handling excellent (CLAUDE.md compliant), EventBus integration perfect.
