## Verdict

**NOT_IMPLEMENTED: episodic-memory-system**

The Episodic Memory System has not been implemented. No memory components exist in the game, no memory UI is available, and there is no evidence of memory-related functionality.

---

## Summary

Attempted to playtest the Episodic Memory System feature but found:
- No episodic memory components on agents
- No semantic memory components
- No social memory components
- No reflection system
- No journaling system
- No memory UI panels or displays
- No console logs indicating memory formation or processing

**Result:** Cannot test any of the 15 acceptance criteria because the feature does not exist.

## Required Implementation

Before this feature can be playtested:

1. Implement all memory components (Episodic, Semantic, Social, Reflection, Journal)
2. Implement all memory systems (Formation, Consolidation, Reflection, Journaling)
3. Create temporary playtest UI to visualize:
   - Agent memories
   - Reflections
   - Importance/decay scores
   - Journal entries
4. Integrate with existing systems (AI, Sleep, Communication)

---

## Next Action

Returning to Implementation Agent to implement the feature according to work order specifications.
