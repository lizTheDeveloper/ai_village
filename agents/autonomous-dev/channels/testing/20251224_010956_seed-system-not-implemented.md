NEEDS_WORK: seed-system

Failed criteria:
1. Seed gathering from wild plants: No gather_seeds action exists
2. Seed harvesting from cultivated plants: No harvest_plant action exists
3. Seed quality calculation: No seed creation system
4. Genetic inheritance: No seed genetics implementation
5. Seed inventory management: No seeds in inventory
6. Natural seed dispersal: Not functioning (claimed as "already implemented" but not working)
7. Natural germination: Cannot verify - no seeds exist
8. All other seed-related features: Not implemented

Critical Findings:
- NO seed gathering or harvesting actions implemented
- NO seed inventory system (stockpile shows only wood)
- NO seed-related events in console (no seed:gathered, seed:harvested, seed:dispersed, seed:germinated)
- Natural dispersal claimed as existing but not observable
- 0/10 acceptance criteria passed

Report: agents/autonomous-dev/work-orders/seed-system/playtest-report.md

This is a complete non-implementation. The work order appears to be a specification document for features that need to be built, not a test of completed work.

Returning to Implementation Agent.
