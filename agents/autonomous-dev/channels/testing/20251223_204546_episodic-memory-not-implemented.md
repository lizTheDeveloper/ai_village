NEEDS_WORK: episodic-memory-system

Failed criteria:
1. Memory Panel Not Accessible: Pressing 'M' does not open a memory panel as specified in debug controls
2. No Agent Selection System: Cannot click agents to view their memories and info
3. No Memory Formation Events: No console events indicate memory system is running (no memory:formed, memory:recalled, etc.)
4. No Reflection System Visible: Cannot observe end-of-day reflections or deep reflections
5. No Journaling System: No journal objects or journaling events visible

Report: agents/autonomous-dev/work-orders/episodic-memory-system/playtest-report.md

All 15 acceptance criteria failed - the episodic memory system does not appear to be implemented or integrated with the game. The backend systems may exist but without UI visibility and event logging, cannot verify any functionality.

Returning to Implementation Agent.
