# Multiverse Crossing System - Divine Focus

## Core Philosophy

Universe crossing is **ridiculously expensive** but has **many pathways**. No single method dominates - different approaches suit different situations, entities, and universes. The key insight: creating semi-permanent **Passages** between universes dramatically reduces subsequent crossing costs, making the first crossing a monumental investment that pays dividends over time.

### Why So Expensive?

Universes are not just "parallel dimensions" - they are **complete, self-contained realities** with their own:
- Fundamental physical laws
- Magic paradigms (completely different rules)
- Divine hierarchies and presence spectrums
- Space, time, and causality configurations

Crossing means **translating your entire existence** from one reality's rules to another. A presence that exists through attention in Universe A must be re-established through attention mechanisms that may work completely differently in Universe B.

## The Cost Framework

### Base Crossing Cost (One-Time, Cold Crossing)

| Entity Type | Attention/Belief Cost | Equivalent Human Effort |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Mortal | 10,000 | Civilization-defining ritual |
| Spirit (0.15-0.45) | 50,000 | Generations of worship |
| Kami (0.45-0.75) | 200,000 | Empire-scale devotion |
| Deity (0.75-0.90) | 1,000,000 | Millennial faith traditions |
| Transcendent (0.90+) | 5,000,000+ | Universe-age belief accumulation |

These costs are **intentionally prohibitive**. A transcendent presence spending 5 million attention would drop significantly on the spectrum - potentially from 0.95 to 0.60.

### Cost Modifiers

```
Base Cost × Universe Distance × Compatibility Factor × Entity Mass

Universe Distance: 1.0 (similar) to 10.0 (utterly alien)
Compatibility Factor: 0.5 (compatible magic) to 5.0 (hostile paradigms)
Entity Mass: 1.0 (lone traveler) to 100.0 (army + artifacts + temples)
```

## Passage Types (Semi-Permanent Connections)

Once the enormous cost of first crossing is paid, entities can create **Passages** - semi-permanent connections that dramatically reduce future crossing costs.

### Passage Categories

#### 1. Thread Passages (Weakest)
- **Creation Cost**: 5% of cold crossing cost
- **Crossing Cost Once Established**: 20% of cold crossing
- **Duration**: Decays over years without maintenance
- **Capacity**: One entity at a time
- **Detectability**: Nearly invisible
- **Vulnerability**: Easily severed by hostile presences

*Think of a spider's thread stretched between universes - fragile but functional.*

#### 2. Bridge Passages
- **Creation Cost**: 20% of cold crossing cost
- **Crossing Cost Once Established**: 5% of cold crossing
- **Duration**: Decades without maintenance
- **Capacity**: Small groups
- **Detectability**: Visible to those who know how to look
- **Vulnerability**: Requires significant effort to destroy

*A sturdy rope bridge - reliable but limited.*

#### 3. Gate Passages
- **Creation Cost**: 50% of cold crossing cost
- **Crossing Cost Once Established**: 1% of cold crossing
- **Duration**: Centuries without maintenance
- **Capacity**: Armies
- **Detectability**: Obviously visible, draws attention
- **Vulnerability**: Defended structure, hard to destroy

*A proper portal gate - expensive but highly efficient.*

#### 4. Confluence Passages (Strongest)
- **Creation Cost**: 100% of cold crossing cost (but shared by both sides)
- **Crossing Cost Once Established**: 0.1% of cold crossing
- **Duration**: Permanent unless deliberately severed
- **Capacity**: Unlimited
- **Detectability**: Visible across both universes
- **Vulnerability**: Requires cooperation from both sides to sever

*Two universes partially merged at a point - the universes themselves want to connect here.*

## Divine Crossing Methods

### Method 1: Presence Extension (0.60+ Required)

**Concept**: Rather than moving, the presence *extends* itself into the new universe while maintaining its anchor in the home universe.

**Process**:
1. Establish worship in target universe (requires mortal agents or existing connections)
2. Channel attention from home universe to "seed" presence in target
3. Gradually shift attention-generation to target universe
4. Optionally collapse home presence (or maintain dual presence)

**Costs**:
- Initial seeding: 100,000 attention
- Maintaining dual presence: 10% attention decay penalty per tick
- Full transition: Standard cold crossing cost

**Advantages**:
- Lowest risk - can retreat if target universe is hostile
- Maintains home power base during transition
- Can eventually have presence in multiple universes

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires mortal agents or existing passage
- Very slow (generations)
- Split attention weakens both presences

**Best For**: Patient deities, multi-universe pantheons

---

### Method 2: Divine Projection (0.75+ Required)

**Concept**: Send a fragment of divine essence - an avatar or manifestation - through to the other universe. The projection is weaker but can establish presence and potentially return.

**Process**:
1. Create divine projection (costs 20% of current attention)
2. Project crosses (costs 10% of cold crossing)
3. Projection operates semi-independently in target universe
4. Projection can create passages for main presence
5. Main presence can absorb returning projection (or not)

**Costs**:
- Projection creation: 20% of attention
- Projection crossing: 10% of cold crossing cost
- Projection maintenance: Projection has own attention economy, decays if not worshipped

**Advantages**:
- Main presence stays safe
- Can scout target universe
- Projection might accumulate its own power

**Disadvantages**:
- Projection is much weaker (starts at 0.30-0.40 even from high presence)
- May be vulnerable in target universe
- Projection could become independent (or corrupted)

**Best For**: Exploration, establishing footholds

---

### Method 3: Divine Conveyance (0.85+ Required)

**Concept**: A more powerful presence can *carry* lesser entities across. The greater presence pays the cost and acts as a protective shell.

**Process**:
1. Greater presence pays crossing cost for all conveyed entities
2. Conveyed entities exist within greater presence during transit
3. Upon arrival, entities are "released" into target universe
4. Conveyed entities must establish their own presence in target

**Costs**:
- Full cold crossing cost for the carrier
- +10% per entity conveyed
- Conveyed entities arrive at 50% of their normal spectrum position

**Advantages**:
- Can move entire pantheons
- Lesser entities don't need to meet individual crossing requirements
- Group stays together

**Disadvantages**:
- Enormous cost to carrier
- Conveyed entities weakened on arrival
- If carrier fails in transit, all conveyed are lost

**Best For**: Divine migrations, pantheon relocations

---

### Method 4: Worship Tunnel (0.70+ Required)

**Concept**: If mortals in two universes worship the same concept/entity, their belief creates a natural tunnel that the presence can traverse.

**Process**:
1. Identical or near-identical worship practices must exist in both universes
2. When worship "syncs" (same ritual at same conceptual moment), tunnel opens
3. Presence can flow through during sync window
4. Tunnel duration based on worship intensity

**Costs**:
- No direct attention cost to presence
- Requires extensive mortal preparation (expensive in mortal terms)
- Crossing window may be brief

**Advantages**:
- Cheapest method for the divine entity itself
- Natural and sustainable
- Creates immediate worship base in target

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires coordination across universes (how?)
- Dependent on mortal capability
- Vulnerable during transit
- Target universe worshippers may have different expectations

**Best For**: Entities with strong mortal cult organizations

---

### Method 5: Cosmic Wound Exploitation (0.50+ Can Attempt)

**Concept**: Some universe pairs have existing damage - tears, rifts, scars from cosmic events. These wounds are easier to cross through, but dangerous.

**Process**:
1. Locate cosmic wound (rare, may require millennia of searching)
2. Navigate wound's hazards
3. Emerge in target universe (location unpredictable)

**Costs**:
- 5-10% of cold crossing cost
- Risk of damage during transit (up to 50% attention loss)
- May attract attention of wound guardians/predators

**Advantages**:
- Much cheaper than cold crossing
- Available to lower-spectrum presences
- Can be repeated

**Disadvantages**:
- Wounds are rare and often guarded
- Dangerous transit
- Unpredictable exit point
- May widen wound (consequences)

**Best For**: Desperate crossings, lower-spectrum entities, explorers

---

### Method 6: Death-Passage (Any Spectrum, Requires Death)

**Concept**: Some entities can cross when they cease to exist in their home universe. Death in one universe can mean birth in another.

**Process**:
1. Entity must truly die/dissolve in home universe (0.0 on spectrum)
2. Residual attention/belief from home universe "seeds" new presence in target
3. Emerges in target at very low spectrum position (0.10-0.20)
4. Must rebuild from nearly nothing

**Costs**:
- Complete loss of home universe presence
- Arrives at minimal power
- Memories may be fragmented or lost

**Advantages**:
- Available to any entity regardless of spectrum position
- No transit vulnerability (you're already dead)
- Fresh start

**Disadvantages**:
- Cannot return (home presence destroyed)
- Massive power loss
- Memory/identity loss common
- No guarantee of emergence in desired target

**Best For**: Last resort, rebirth-seeking entities

---

### Method 7: Anchor Transfer (0.80+ Required)

**Concept**: Rather than moving the presence, move the anchor. If an entity is anchored to an object, move the object between universes.

**Process**:
1. Ensure presence is firmly anchored to portable object
2. Have mortal or other entity physically transport anchor object
3. Presence is "dragged along" with anchor
4. Presence must re-establish in target universe but maintains connection

**Costs**:
- Object crossing cost (much lower than entity crossing)
- Re-anchoring cost in target universe (30% of cold crossing)
- Risk if anchor is damaged in transit

**Advantages**:
- Much cheaper than direct crossing
- Maintains anchor connection
- Presence arrives intact (at anchor location)

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires portable anchor
- Anchor is vulnerable during transit
- Limited to object-anchored presences
- Someone else must carry the anchor

**Best For**: Tsukumogami, object-bound spirits, artifact gods

---

### Method 8: Collective Passage (0.60+ Multiple Entities)

**Concept**: Multiple presences pool resources to create a passage together. Cost is shared, and the passage benefits all contributors.

**Process**:
1. Minimum 3 presences agree to cooperate
2. Each contributes attention to shared pool
3. Pool creates Bridge or Gate passage
4. All contributors can use passage at reduced cost

**Costs**:
- Total cost divided by number of contributors
- Each contributor must contribute minimum 25% of their share
- Passage is "owned" collectively - any contributor can block others

**Advantages**:
- Affordable for medium-spectrum entities
- Creates lasting infrastructure
- Builds inter-presence relationships

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires trust and cooperation
- Political complications
- Single contributor can sabotage

**Best For**: Pantheons, allied spirits, trading networks

---

### Method 9: Transcendent Carving (0.95+ Required)

**Concept**: At the highest spectrum levels, a presence can simply *create* a passage through raw reality manipulation.

**Process**:
1. Transcendent presence focuses reality_manipulation capability
2. Spends enormous attention to "cut" between universes
3. Creates permanent Confluence passage

**Costs**:
- 10,000,000+ attention (drops spectrum position significantly)
- Universe may resist (triggersResistance effects)
- Other transcendent presences may notice and respond

**Advantages**:
- Creates highest-quality passage
- Complete control over passage location and properties
- Statement of cosmic power

**Disadvantages**:
- Only available to near-peak presences
- Enormous cost even for transcendents
- May attract hostile attention
- May damage local space-time fabric

**Best For**: Universe-shaping entities, cosmic infrastructure

---

### Method 10: Syncretism Absorption (Passive)

**Concept**: When believers in different universes independently develop nearly identical concepts of a divine entity, the entity can spontaneously manifest in multiple universes without "crossing."

**Process**:
1. Belief patterns in Universe B independently match presence in Universe A
2. Belief in B begins generating attention for A's presence
3. When attention threshold reached, presence "blooms" in B
4. A and B presence are the same entity (not copies)

**Costs**:
- No direct cost - happens naturally
- Attention in new universe starts from zero
- Must maintain belief in both universes

**Advantages**:
- Free crossing
- Natural and stable
- Presence genuinely belongs in both universes

**Disadvantages**:
- Cannot be controlled or directed
- Very rare natural occurrence
- Belief differences may cause identity strain
- May take eons

**Best For**: Archetypal concepts (Death, Love, War), universal forces

---

## Crossing Hazards

### The Transit Space

Between universes exists something - call it the Void, the Between, the Membrane. Properties:

- **Attention drains faster** (10x normal decay)
- **No anchors possible** (no locations, objects, or concepts)
- **Time is uncertain** (may arrive before you left, or millennia later)
- **Things live there** - entities that exist in no universe, hungry for attention

### Cosmic Predators

Entities that hunt in the spaces between:

- **Attention Leeches**: Drain crossing entities, grow fat on stolen belief
- **Void Shepherds**: Guide travelers for a price (sometimes honest, sometimes not)
- **Passage Parasites**: Attach to passages, tax all traffic
- **Reality Fragments**: Broken pieces of failed universes, toxic to cross
- **The Hungry**: Former presences that died in transit, now predatory ghosts

### Paradigm Shock

When crossing between universes with incompatible magic/divine systems:

- **Magic Translation Failure**: Abilities may not work at all
- **Attention Incompatibility**: Worship in new universe may not "register"
- **Physical Manifestation Errors**: Avatar forms may be impossible
- **Identity Drift**: Core nature may be interpreted differently by new universe

---

## Passage Maintenance & Politics

### Maintaining Passages

All passages except Confluences require maintenance:

| Passage Type | Maintenance Interval | Maintenance Cost |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Thread | Yearly | 1% of creation cost |
| Bridge | Decade | 2% of creation cost |
| Gate | Century | 5% of creation cost |
| Confluence | Never | N/A (permanent) |

Unmaintained passages:
1. First miss: -10% capacity
2. Second miss: -50% capacity, unreliable
3. Third miss: Collapse (may be catastrophic)

### Passage Ownership & Control

Passages can be:
- **Owned**: Single entity controls access
- **Shared**: Multiple entities have rights
- **Public**: Anyone can use (rare, usually guarded)
- **Contested**: Multiple entities claim control

Passage wars are serious divine conflicts. Destroying an enemy's passage is a major act of aggression.

### Passage Networks

Over cosmic time, passage networks form:
- **Trade Routes**: High-traffic passages between compatible universes
- **Sacred Ways**: Religious pilgrimage passages maintained by faith
- **War Roads**: Military passages, heavily defended
- **Hidden Paths**: Secret passages known to few
- **Broken Bridges**: Collapsed passages, sometimes exploitable

---

## Universe Compatibility

### Compatibility Factors

When two universes interact, compatibility affects everything:

| Factor | Compatible | Neutral | Incompatible | Hostile |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Magic Paradigm | Same sources | Different sources | No overlap | Actively opposed |
| Divine System | Similar spectrum | Different rules | No divinity | Anti-divine |
| Physical Laws | Identical | Similar | Very different | Lethal differences |
| Time Flow | Same rate | Different rate | Non-linear | Paradox-prone |
| Morality | Aligned values | Different values | Alien values | Inverted values |

**Compatibility Score**: Average of factors, 0.0 (perfectly compatible) to 5.0 (utterly incompatible)

### Cross-Universe Worship

When mortals from Universe A worship a deity from Universe B:
- Attention crosses naturally (no passage needed)
- Attention transfer efficiency = 1 / Compatibility Score
- Very compatible: 100% transfer
- Neutral: 50% transfer
- Incompatible: 10% transfer
- Hostile: 0% transfer (worship goes to local equivalent or is wasted)

### Foreign Presences

A presence from Universe A existing in Universe B faces:
- **Attention decay multiplier**: Compatibility Score squared
- **Power effectiveness**: 1 / Compatibility Score
- **Manifestation difficulty**: Compatibility Score × normal cost
- **Communication clarity**: 1 / Compatibility Score

In a hostile universe, a presence might decay to nothing within years regardless of worship.

## Special Crossing Scenarios

### Pantheon Migration

When an entire pantheon needs to relocate (home universe dying, lost divine war, etc.):

1. **Scouting Phase**: Send projections to candidate universes
2. **Beachhead Phase**: Establish single presence in target
3. **Passage Creation**: Build Gate or Confluence
4. **Migration Wave**: Divine Conveyance through passage
5. **Establishment Phase**: Build worship base in target
6. **Consolidation**: Possibly close passage to prevent pursuit

Cost: Typically 30-50% of total pantheon attention
Risk: High - failure means pantheon dissolution
Timeline: Centuries to millennia

### Universe Merger

Two compatible universes can partially or fully merge:
- Requires transcendent presences on both sides
- Creates permanent Confluence at cosmic scale
- Physical laws may blend at boundaries
- Divine hierarchies must negotiate
- Mortals experience "reality shifts"

This is an end-game scenario, essentially creating a new larger universe.

### Universe Birth

A sufficiently powerful presence can birth a new universe:
- Requires 0.99+ spectrum position
- Costs effectively all attention (drops to 0.70-ish)
- New universe starts empty but compatible with creator
- Creator is the founding presence of new universe
- Other presences must cross in normally

This is the ultimate form of universe modification.

  | 'death_passage'
  | 'anchor_transfer'
  | 'collective_passage'
  | 'transcendent_carving'
  | 'syncretism_absorption';
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **PresenceSpectrum**: Add multiverse-related capabilities at high spectrum positions
- **UniverseConfig**: Add inter-universe compatibility configuration
- **UniverseModification**: Transcendent carving is a special case of universe modification
- **MagicParadigm**: Foreign magic handling already partially defined

---

## Balance Considerations

### Why This Design?

1. **Expensive First Crossing**: Prevents casual universe-hopping, makes each crossing meaningful
2. **Passage Investment**: Rewards long-term planning and cooperation
3. **Many Methods**: Different approaches for different situations and entity types
4. **Risk/Reward Spectrum**: Cheaper methods have higher risks
5. **Political Implications**: Passages create strategic assets worth fighting over
6. **Late Game Content**: Most methods require high spectrum positions

### Preventing Abuse

- Transcendent entities can't just spam universe creation
- Even with passages, significant costs remain
- Hostile universes are genuinely hostile
- Transit hazards provide risk
- Passage networks take millennia to develop

### Emergent Gameplay

- Passage control becomes geopolitical
- Universe compatibility affects divine diplomacy
- Migration events create story moments
- Multi-universe presences are rare and powerful
- Cosmic predators provide threats even to divine entities

---

## Summary

Universe crossing is the ultimate expression of divine power, requiring:
- Enormous resource expenditure
- Long-term planning
- Often cooperation with others
- Acceptance of significant risks

But once achieved, passages transform the cost calculus, making the initial investment worthwhile for those who can afford it. The multiverse is vast but navigable - for those with the attention to spend.
