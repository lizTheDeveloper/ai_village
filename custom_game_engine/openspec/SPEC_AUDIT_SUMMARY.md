## Implementation Patterns

### What's Working Well ✅

1. **Component-System Architecture**
   - All components follow lowercase_with_underscores convention
   - Type safety enforced throughout
   - Event-driven with proper emission

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Object pools in context builders
   - Cached queries and pre-allocation
   - Zero-allocation hot paths
   - Fast PRNG (xorshift32) for deterministic rolls

3. **Tier Hierarchies**
   - Spatial: 11 tiers fully coded
   - Ship: 6 tiers complete with components
   - Political: 7 tiers with components (3 working systems)

### Common Gaps ❌

1. **Integration over Implementation**
   - Systems exist but don't drive state changes
   - "90% built, 10% integrated" pattern
   - Example: LLM governors generate decisions but don't execute them

2. **High-Tier Gameplay Missing**
   - Federation & Galactic Council: Components but no systems
   - Empire: Stub implementation
   - Trade Network Tier 3+: Design only

3. **Economic Simulation Incomplete**
   - Navy budgets defined but not processed
   - Megastructure maintenance resources not consumed
   - Production chain scaling theoretical

4. **Testing Gaps**
   - Hierarchy simulator: 0 tests passing
   - Most new systems: No integration tests
   - Target: 80%+ coverage, actual: ~20%

## Code Volume by System

| System | Lines of Code | Files | Status |
|--------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Multiverse | 2,500+ | 12 | 88% |
| Governance | 5,154 | 15 | 55% |
| Hierarchy Simulator | 1,167 | 4 tiers | 85% |
| Ship Systems | 3,000+ | 14 | 85% |
| Megastructures | 1,437 + 1,543 JSON | 5 | 55% |
| Trade | 1,850 | 6 | 40% |
| Technology | 546 + data | 4 | 70% |

**Total:** ~15,000+ lines of production code

## Critical Bottlenecks

### 1. Decision Execution Gap
**Impact:** High - Governors can't affect gameplay
**Effort:** Medium - Wire existing decisions to state changes
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

### 2. Megastructure Activation
**Impact:** High - Construction completes but doesn't work
**Effort:** Low - Single function completion
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

### 3. High-Tier Systems Missing
**Impact:** High - Can't play at Empire+ scale
**Effort:** High - 3-4 new systems
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

### 4. Trade Network Tier 3
**Impact:** Medium - Economic strategy incomplete
**Effort:** High - Graph analysis complex
**Priority:** ⭐⭐ Important

### 5. Testing Coverage
**Impact:** Medium - Stability concerns
**Effort:** High - Comprehensive test suite
**Priority:** ⭐ Nice-to-have

## Next Actions (Week 1 Focus)

### Monday-Tuesday: LLM Governor Execution
- Wire `GovernorDecisionSystem` to action executors
- Start with Province tier (simplest)
- Test: Province requests aid → Resources transferred

### Wednesday-Thursday: Megastructure Activation
- Implement `createOperationalMegastructure()`
- Wire maintenance resource consumption
- Test: Space Station → Operational component created

### Friday: City Governance
- Create `CityGovernanceComponent` schema
- Link `CityDirectorSystem` to component
- Test: Budget allocation → Departments updated

**Goal:** Complete Phase 1 (Critical Integration) in 2-3 weeks

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete (Integration):**
- [ ] Emperor declares war → Armies mobilize
- [ ] Dyson Swarm built → Operational, generates energy
- [ ] Province governor allocates resources → Transfers occur
- [ ] City director sets budget → Departments funded

**Phase 2 Complete (High-Tier):**
- [ ] Federation votes on law → Enforcement occurs
- [ ] Galactic Council mediates → Peacekeeping deployed
- [ ] Empire manages vassals → Loyalty tracked, rebellions occur

**Phase 3 Complete (Economic):**
- [ ] Trade network blockaded → Chokepoint identified, regions starve
- [ ] Navy runs out of budget → Ships mothballed
- [ ] Resources discovered → Era advancement unlocked

**Production Ready (All Phases):**
- [ ] All 7 political tiers functional
- [ ] All 5 trade tiers working
- [ ] All 6 ship tiers operational
- [ ] Multiverse travel with invasions/paradoxes/merging
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] 20 TPS performance at all scales
