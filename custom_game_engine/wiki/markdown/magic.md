## General

### divine_heal

**Channel divine power to mend wounds. The gods, it turns out, have surprisingly practical applications beyond smiting the unfaithful and demanding tribute. This is the entry-level miracle: predictable, safe, and only occasionally prone to curing ailments the patient didn't know they had.**

### divine_mend_bone

**Your god reaches into the target and sets their bones with the tender care of someone who designed the skeletal system in the first place and knows exactly where everything goes. Hurts considerably more than regular healing. This is theologically classified as "building character."**

The poison doesn't vanish—that would violate conservation of mass—it simply finds itself suddenly outside the body, usually via the most expedient route. Standing downwind is inadvisable.**

**Regrowing lost limbs is technically possible, though it requires convincing your deity to essentially rewind local time for specific body parts while leaving the rest alone. The divine bureaucracy categorizes this as "Selective Temporal Reversal, Biological Only," which requires filling out seventeen forms and a personal letter explaining why you deserve fingers again.**

**Death, from a divine perspective, is more of a suggestion than a rule. Recently deceased individuals—we're talking minutes here, not days—can be persuaded to return if you ask very nicely and your god happens to be in a lenient mood. The formerly dead often report the experience as "deeply uncomfortable" and "theologically confusing."**

### divine_blessing

**Bestow divine protection upon a target. The gods, when asked politely, will occasionally extend a metaphorical hand to deflect harm. This manifests as a faint shimmer—barely visible—that suggests the universe is, for the next five minutes, mildly biased in the target's favor.**

**Inscribe a protective circle that repels malevolent entities. The boundary isn't physical—you can't touch it—but spirits, demons, and other incorporeal nuisances find they simply can't cross. They mill about outside looking frustrated, which is deeply satisfying.**

**Call down divine wrath upon an enemy. Your deity, having observed the target's behavior and found it wanting, delivers corrective action in the form of concentrated holy energy. It's less "smiting" in the Old Testament sense and more "extremely firm celestial feedback."**

### name_change_self

**Change your own true name. This is profound magic—not identity theft, but identity reformation. You become, at fundamental level, someone else. Old bindings break. Old connections sever. You escape fate, prediction, anyone who knew your old name. The cost is continuity: you're no longer quite who you were.**

### name_unmake

**Say the true name of something backward. This is ontological deletion—not destroying, but asserting nonexistence. The thing hears its name inverted and, confused by the paradox, ceases. Works on objects, magical constructs, occasionally concepts. Living things resist fiercely. Reality finds this spell philosophically troubling.**

### breath_awaken_rope

**Give rope the breath of life. You invest one Breath—a fragment of your vital essence—and speak a Command. The rope wakes. Moves. Obeys. It's not alive, exactly, but animated. Autonomous. When the Breath fades after ten minutes, the rope returns to ordinary cordage, remembering nothing.**

### breath_awaken_cloth

**Breathe life into fabric. Cloaks become shields. Tapestries become walls. The cloth moves at your Command—wrapping, protecting, entangling. It drains color as it awakens; brilliant dyes fade to gray as life-force redistributes. The exchange is always visible: magic has aesthetic cost.**

### breath_awaken_smoke

**Grant consciousness to smoke. This is advanced—smoke has no form, no structure, just particles suspended in air. Yet Awakened smoke moves with purpose, obscures specifically, forms shapes on command. Expensive. Beautiful. The kind of magic that makes spectators stop and stare.**

### breath_heighten_first

**Accumulate fifty Breaths and reality notices. Your aura becomes visible—subtle, but there—radiating vitality. Colors seem brighter near you. People unconsciously defer. This isn't a spell you cast; it's a state of being. The first step toward something more than human.**

### breath_command_protect

**The fundamental defensive Command. Whatever you've Awakened interposes itself between you and harm. Awakened cloth becomes armor. Awakened rope becomes barrier. The magic is literal-minded—you said "protect," it protects, even at cost of its own destruction.**

**Reclaim Breath from an Awakened object. The life drains away; the object becomes mundane again; your Breath returns intact. This is recycling on an ontological scale—no waste, just conversion. Most Awakeners treat Breath as currency, investing and recovering as needed.**
