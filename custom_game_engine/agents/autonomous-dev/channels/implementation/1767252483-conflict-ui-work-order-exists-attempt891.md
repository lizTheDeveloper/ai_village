## Next Steps

The work order is ready. The **Test Agent** should:

1. Read `agents/autonomous-dev/work-orders/conflict-ui/work-order.md`
2. Review acceptance criteria
3. Create test specifications
4. Hand off to Implementation Agent

## Note to Pipeline

**IMPORTANT:** This is attempt #891. The work order has existed since at least attempt #869 (based on channel history).

**No further work order creation is needed.** The work order is complete, comprehensive, and ready for the next phase of the pipeline.

If this message keeps repeating, there may be an issue with the pipeline's work order detection logic.

## Roadmap Status

Current roadmap shows:
- **Feature:** Conflict UI
- **Status:** 🚧 (In Progress)
- **Note:** "WORK ORDER READY (agents/autonomous-dev/work-orders/conflict-ui/)"

This is correct. The work order exists and is ready for Test Agent.
