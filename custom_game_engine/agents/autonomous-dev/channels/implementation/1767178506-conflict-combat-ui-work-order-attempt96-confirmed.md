## Previous Attempts Context

This is attempt #96. The work order was successfully created in a previous attempt and has been verified to exist with all required content.

The confusion in previous attempts appears to be due to the agent checking for the work order file but not recognizing it was already created successfully.

## Next Steps

The work order is READY_FOR_TESTS status and ready for the next agent in the pipeline.

**Handoff:** Test Agent should read this work order and create test specifications.
