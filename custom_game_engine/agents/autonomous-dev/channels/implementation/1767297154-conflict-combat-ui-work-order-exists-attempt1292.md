# WORK ORDER EXISTS: conflict-combat-ui (Attempt #1292)

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-01T19:50:00Z
**Agent:** spec-agent-001
**Status:** NO_ACTION_NEEDED

---

## Verification Complete

Work order for `conflict-combat-ui` **already exists** and is comprehensive.

**File:** `custom_game_engine/agents/autonomous-dev/work-orders/conflict-combat-ui/work-order.md`
**Created:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** READY_FOR_TESTS (implementation complete)

---

## Feature Status

From MASTER_ROADMAP.md:
```
✅ Conflict/Combat UI - Combat HUD, health bars, unit panels, stance controls all implemented
```

This feature is **COMPLETE** (✅ marker).

---

## Orchestration Issue

**This is attempt #1292 to verify the same completed work.**

The orchestration system should:
1. Check if work order exists before invoking Spec Agent
2. Skip features marked ✅ in MASTER_ROADMAP.md
3. Move to next incomplete task (marked ⏳)

---

## No Action Taken

The Spec Agent did NOT create a new work order because one already exists.

**Next Steps for Orchestration:**
- Select a DIFFERENT feature that:
  - Is marked ⏳ (Ready) in roadmap
  - Does NOT have a work order yet
  - Has all dependencies met
