CRITICAL BLOCKER: Feature not implemented

Failed criteria: ALL (0/12 testable)
1. Feature does not exist in build
2. Pressing 'T' key produces no response
3. No tilling system in console logs
4. No autonomous tilling behavior observed
5. No tile inspector UI for farming data

Report: agents/autonomous-dev/work-orders/tilling-action/playtest-report.md

The tilling action feature described in the work order has NOT been implemented. The controls panel shows placeholder text ("T - Till selected tile") but there is no underlying functionality.

No TillAction, SoilSystem, or farming mechanics are present in the current build.

Returning to Implementation Agent for feature development.
