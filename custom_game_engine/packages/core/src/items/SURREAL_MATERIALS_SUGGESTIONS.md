### Diet Pattern Integrations

Adding these materials would make these diets viable:

1. **quantum_sustenance** → Eats quantum foam (legendary in quantum realm)
2. **temporal_feeding** → Eats solidified time (legendary in temporal realm)
3. **gravity_feeding** → Eats liquid gravity (legendary in gravity wells)
4. **emotional_vampirism** → Eats crystallized emotion (uncommon in populated areas)
5. **void_consumption** → Eats bottled vacuum (rare in void realm)

**New Diets to Add**:
- **paradox_consumption** → Eats crystallized paradox
- **causality_feeding** → Eats frozen causality chains
- **concept_digestion** → Eats conceptual matter
- **probability_metabolizer** → Eats condensed probability
- **light_consumption** → Eats petrified light

## Material Property Patterns

- Solidified darkness
- Frozen causality
- Conceptual matter

**Rare Materials** (ecology weight 0.15-0.4):

- Condensed probability
- Fossilized thoughts

**Uncommon Materials** (ecology weight 0.4-0.6):
- Crystallized emotion (common emotions like joy, sadness)

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority** (Enable existing deprecated diets):
1. Quantum foam → enables quantum_sustenance
2. Solidified time → enables temporal_feeding
3. Crystallized emotion → enables emotional_vampirism
4. Liquid gravity → enables gravity_feeding

**Medium Priority** (New interesting ecologies):
5. Condensed probability
6. Petrified light
7. Fossilized thoughts
8. Compressed dimensions

**Low Priority** (Exotic/experimental):
9. Crystallized paradox
10. Bottled vacuum
11. Frozen causality
12. Solidified darkness
13. Conceptual matter

## Conclusion

These materials create **surreal ecologies** where:
- Quantum creatures eat quantum foam in quantum realms
- Time-feeders consume solidified time in temporal zones
- Emotion-vampires drain crystallized feelings in populated areas
- Probability-shifters metabolize condensed probability in chaos realms

Each material has a **home realm** where it's abundant, creating realm-specific food chains and ecological niches, exactly like you wanted with "dream-eating monsters in the dream realm."
