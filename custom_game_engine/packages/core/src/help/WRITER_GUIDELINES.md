# Writer Guidelines for Help Text

Documentation in this game blends four distinct voices to create rich, entertaining, and informative help entries. Use these styles freely and blend them as appropriate for the content.

## The Four Voices

### Voice 1: The Baroque Encyclopedist

**Characteristics:**
- Mischievous, playful, encyclopedic
- Delights in invented worlds that feel older than they are
- Stuffed with footnotes, digressions, fake scholarship, grotesque-but-affectionate detail
- Pauses narrative to luxuriate in maps, marginalia, fictional authors, absurd taxonomies
- Childlike glee in exaggeration paired with deep respect for storytelling as craft, myth, and artifact
- Humor arises from excess, invention, and worldbuilding taken slightly too far

**When to use:**
- Lore-heavy entries about ancient magic systems
- Item descriptions with rich backstories
- Historical context for crafting traditions
- Taxonomies of magical creatures or materials

**Example:**
> The Grimoire of Thaumaturgical Resonances* was first compiled by the insufferable but undeniably brilliant Archmage Thistlebroom III in the Year of the Comet (though which comet remains a matter of heated scholarly debate—see Appendix VII for Dr. Crankshaft's exhaustive and exhausting treatise on celestial chronology). The tome catalogs no fewer than 247 distinct varieties of mana crystallization, each with its own peculiar footnotes regarding optimal harvesting conditions, regional superstitions, and the somewhat alarming tendency of certain specimens to develop opinions about their owners.**
>
> *Not to be confused with the far inferior "Grimoire of Thaumaturgical Resonances" by Archmage Thistlebroom II, which was later discovered to be mostly plagiarized from a cookbook.
>
> **Particularly specimens from the Whispering Wastes, which have been known to file complaints with the Mages' Guild.

### Voice 2: The Cosmic Pragmatist

**Characteristics:**
- Dry, cosmic, cheerfully nihilistic
- Treats the vastness of the universe as both ridiculous and mildly annoying
- Deadpan understatement punctures anything important
- Comedy from logical misalignment: bureaucracies applied to infinity, everyday inconveniences scaled to galactic proportions
- Lean, fast, conversational prose
- Punchlines embedded mid-sentence
- Tone suggests narrator is perpetually amused but never impressed

**When to use:**
- Game mechanics explanations
- System limitations and constraints
- Death, resurrection, and cosmic consequences
- Bureaucratic divine systems

**Example:**
> Death, as it turns out, is less a permanent condition and more of a paperwork problem. The Eternal Bureaucracy—which manages the transition between corporeal existence and whatever comes next—processes approximately forty-seven billion souls per standard galactic week, which would be impressively efficient if not for the fact that the forms are only available in Celestial Sanskrit and must be filed in triplicate. Many souls simply give up and become ghosts, which is technically against regulation 4,892-B(iii) but nobody's been bothered to enforce it for the last three eons. The Reaper assigned to your sector is named Derek and he's very sorry about the inconvenience.

### Voice 3: The Humane Satirist

**Characteristics:**
- Expansive, humane, structurally playful
- Builds elaborate comic set-pieces while never losing sight of people
- Satire illuminates rather than sneers
- Mocks institutions, myths, and power structures because they matter
- Generous and rhythmic language
- Running jokes and callbacks
- Capable of stopping for moments of moral clarity
- Strong ethical spine: kindness, responsibility, doing the right thing is hard, unglamorous, and necessary

**When to use:**
- Social systems (trading, governance, religion)
- Character-driven magic costs (sacrifice, emotion, relationships)
- Moral choices and consequences
- Community-building mechanics

**Example:**
> The problem with accidentally becoming a deity—and it was always accidental; nobody in their right mind would volunteer for this—was that belief had momentum. Once a critical mass of villagers decided you were responsible for the harvest, you were. Didn't matter if you were just a traveling tinker who happened to fix Old Marjorie's well during the drought. Didn't matter if you specifically told them you were absolutely, definitely not a god. The prayers started anyway, sheepish at first, then increasingly demanding.
>
> And here was the thing nobody mentioned in the theological texts: the moment you accepted the first prayer—even just to be polite, even just because little Timmy looked so hopeful asking for his sick dog to get better—you were done for. The belief flowed in and suddenly you could feel every wheat stalk in the valley, every anxious farmer checking the sky. You were responsible now. Not because you wanted to be. Not because you had any idea what you were doing. But because someone believed you did, and belief, as it turns out, is considerably more powerful than mere reality.

### Voice 4: The Quiet Mythweaver

**Characteristics:**
- Lyrical, intimate, quietly uncanny
- Blurs boundary between myth and mundane
- Supernatural slips gently into ordinary life rather than erupting
- Restrained, elegant prose
- More interested in mood and resonance than overt punchlines
- Lets implications linger rather than resolve
- Unfolds like modern folktales: concerned with identity, stories themselves, cost of desire or transformation
- Soft-spoken but serious
- Invites reader to lean in rather than laugh out loud

**When to use:**
- Dream magic and liminal spaces
- True Name magic and identity
- Transformation and shapeshifting
- Ancestor worship and spirit communication
- Personal magical awakenings

**Example:**
> The first time you speak a thing's true name, you understand why some knowledge was meant to remain hidden. The word arrives not as sound but as recognition—the way you might suddenly remember a dream that's been waiting at the edge of consciousness. Your mouth shapes syllables that predate language, and the thing named turns to look at you with eyes that have always been looking, will always be looking, because names exist outside time's current.
>
> The oak tree shivers. Not from wind. The shiver comes from being seen, truly seen, perhaps for the first time since its acorn-beginning. You feel its roots stretching into earth's memory, its leaves translating starlight into green thought. You know its first frost, its summer heaviness, the year lightning split its trunk and it grew around the wound.
>
> And it knows you, now. That's the price. Names open doors in both directions.

## Blending the Voices

The best help entries weave these voices together naturally:

1. **Start with the Quiet Mythweaver** to draw readers in
2. **Build with the Baroque Encyclopedist** for rich detail
3. **Ground with the Cosmic Pragmatist** for mechanics
4. **Land with the Humane Satirist** for meaningful context

Or reverse the order. Or skip one entirely. The goal is writing that is:
- **Informative** (players learn how systems work)
- **Entertaining** (reading help is a joy, not a chore)
- **Meaningful** (mechanics connect to themes and emotions)

## What NOT to Do

- Don't be dry and technical unless you're the Cosmic Pragmatist being funny about it
- Don't explain jokes or wink at the reader
- Don't break the fourth wall except for cosmic observations
- Don't let whimsy obscure critical mechanical information
- Don't be mean-spirited—satire should illuminate, not mock

## Examples by Content Type

### Magic Systems
Blend Voice 1 (lore) + Voice 4 (transformation) + Voice 2 (mechanics)

### Crafting Recipes
Blend Voice 1 (history) + Voice 3 (human context) + Voice 2 (dry instructions)

### Divine Interventions
Blend Voice 3 (responsibility) + Voice 4 (uncanny) + Voice 2 (bureaucracy)

### Death and Resurrection
Blend Voice 2 (cosmic absurdity) + Voice 3 (moral weight) + Voice 4 (liminal space)

## The Golden Rule

**Every help entry should make the player smile while teaching them something.**

If you're not enjoying writing it, the player won't enjoy reading it.
