  description: `# Binding Words in Blood: The Fundamentals of Blood Oaths

By Dr. Cordelia Haemsworth, Department of Contractual Thaumaturgy, The Vermillion Academy

---

The practice of binding agreements through blood has existed since the First Agreement*, a practice that predates written law by approximately seventeen centuries† and written language by approximately twelve‡. The fundamental principle remains elegantly simple: blood, being the carrier of one's vital essence**, serves as both signature and seal upon the fabric of reality itself. When properly inscribed with intent and witnessed by the appropriate entities††, a blood oath creates what the Covenant Commission calls a "Type-7 Reality Enforcement Mechanism"—which is to say, an agreement that the universe itself will uphold‡‡. The process requires three elements: the blood of all contracting parties (minimum 2.7 milliliters per party, though the Guild recommends 3 for margin of error)***; words of binding spoken with genuine intent†††; and ideally, though not always essentially, witnesses to anchor the oath in consensual reality‡‡‡.

The consequences of oath-breaking vary depending on the specific wording of the contract, but the universe appears to have a particular fondness for poetic justice****. Minor oaths result in proportional discomfort—an inability to sleep soundly, persistent minor injuries, or what the Healer's College calls "existential itching"†††††. More significant oaths invoke more dramatic responses‡‡‡‡. The exact mechanism remains debated*****, but the effect is consistent: reality itself becomes hostile to the oath-breaker's intentions until the debt is satisfied or the oath-holder releases them††††††. The infamous Merchant's Compact of 1247‡‡‡‡‡ serves as the canonical cautionary tale, wherein three hundred and forty-seven merchants discovered simultaneously that reality had strong opinions about their attempt to form a price-fixing cartel*******.

Perhaps the most critical aspect of blood oath construction—and the one most frequently neglected by novices—is the precise wording of the agreement itself********. The oath binds not to intent but to literal interpretation†††††††, a fact that has generated seventeen volumes of case law‡‡‡‡‡‡ and kept the Arbiters' Guild in business for six consecutive centuries. Words like "forever" must be defined********* (until death? Until the heat death of the universe? Until next Tuesday?), and vague terms like "fair share" or "reasonable effort" create what legal scholars call "reality wobble"††††††††—a state where the universe itself becomes uncertain about what counts as compliance‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. The presence of witnesses serves not merely as proof of the oath's creation but as anchors for interpretation**********; three witnesses who agree on what the words meant at the time of binding create a form of definitional stability that protects all parties from the worst excesses of linguistic drift†††††††††.

The formal process of blood oath creation requires preparation that many amateur practitioners consider excessive‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ but which the accumulated casualty statistics suggest is entirely reasonable***********. The space should be cleansed of other magical influences (particularly important if you've recently performed any transmutation work or demon summoning)††††††††††; all parties should be of sound mind and not under duress‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ (the famous Coercion Paradox*********** means forced oaths sometimes bind the coercer instead); and the exact wording should be written down and reviewed by at least one person trained in contractual thaumaturgy†††††††††††. Blood should be freely given‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, drawn with clean implements************, and mixed in prescribed patterns***********—a circle for equal partners, a triangle for three-way agreements, a pentagon for complex multi-party arrangements, and whatever blessed shape emerges naturally for anything involving more than seven signatories†††††††††††.

Modern practitioners often question whether blood oaths remain necessary in an age of standardized legal contracts and truth-binding spells*************, but the statistics speak clearly: a properly constructed blood oath has a 99.97% enforcement rate‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, compared to 76% for legal contracts and 84% for truth bindings**************. The blood remembers***************; the words endure; and reality, in its infinite patience††††††††††††, keeps score. As the First Binder supposedly said: "Let your word be your bond, and your blood be your seal—for the universe keeps better records than any court of law."‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡

*According to legend, made between the Sun and the Moon regarding who would illuminate which hours. The Moon is still slightly resentful about getting the night shift, which is why it sometimes refuses to show up at all.

†Though the Chronological Disputes Committee argues it might have been eighteen or nineteen centuries, depending on which calendar you use and whether you count the Years That Weren't, when reality was still settling on how time should work.

‡Written language itself may have been invented specifically to record blood oaths, suggesting that literacy is technically a subset of legal magic. The Scribes' Guild has been dining out on this fact for generations.

**And before anyone asks: yes, you need your own blood. Using someone else's creates what the texts politely call an "asymmetric binding" and what victims call "involuntary servitude." The Ethics Board has Feelings about this.

††Witnesses need not be physical beings. Wind, stone, and the small gods of crossroads all count, though wind is notoriously unreliable for testimony later‡. The stones remember everything but take centuries to give testimony. The small gods are usually your best bet, assuming you can find one who isn't busy.

‡One famous case involved a contract witnessed solely by a strong northerly gale. When disputes arose, they had to wait for another northerly gale of equivalent strength and then somehow communicate with it. The case is still technically pending.

‡‡"Reality Enforcement Mechanism" replaced the previous term, "Cosmic Compliance Compulsion," after the Public Relations Office noted that "CCC" sounded too much like a government agency, which made people trust it less.

***The 0.3 milliliters of margin exists because of the Trembling Hand Incident of 1634, wherein a nervous practitioner spilled 0.4 milliliters and the oath bound at 87% strength, which caused what observers described as "uncomfortable partial obligation" for all involved.

†††Lying while making a blood oath is technically possible but inadvisable. The oath binds to what you meant in your heart, not what you said with your mouth, which led to the Ironwood Contradiction: a man who swore to protect a village while secretly planning to destroy it found himself compelled to protect it even from himself. He spent three confused weeks hiring guards to watch him, then hiring guards to watch those guards, then hiring guards to watch those guards. The village is now the most well-defended hamlet in the eastern provinces, and he still lives there, paying their salaries, grinding his teeth.

‡‡‡"Ideally" here means "if you want any hope of winning a dispute later." Unwitnessed oaths are valid but impossible to verify, which creates interesting situations in divorce proceedings.

****The academic debate about whether reality has a sense of humor has raged for centuries. The evidence strongly suggests it does, and that it tends toward the ironic.

†††††First identified by Dr. Malachi Scratchworth in his seminal work "Why Does Everything Itch?: Supernatural Consequences of Minor Infractions." He developed the condition while researching it, adding a melancholic layer of irony to his later career.

‡‡‡‡The Great Oath of Eternal Brotherhood between Lord Fennick and Sir Dustworth resulted in them being unable to physically separate by more than one hundred yards for the rest of their natural lives. They grew to hate each other by year three. They lived to ninety-seven. There's a statue of them in the Square of Cautionary Examples, forever cast in bronze, standing exactly ninety-nine yards apart and looking in opposite directions.

*****Three main theories exist: the Resonance Theory (reality vibrates at specific frequencies and oath-breaking creates discord); the Debt Theory (the universe maintains a balance sheet); and the Personal Preference Theory (reality just doesn't like liars). Proponents of each have occasionally sworn blood oaths that their theory is correct, which has created some interesting situations‡‡`,

  description: `INFERNAL AGREEMENTS: BLOOD PACTS WITH OTHERWORLDLY ENTITIES

The negotiation and formalization of contracts with infernal entities represents one of the most legally complex and physiologically demanding fields of arcane study. While many practitioners are drawn to such agreements by promises of power, wealth, or the ability to finally win arguments with their mothers-in-law*, the fundamental misunderstanding of demonic economics has led to what the Interdimensional Bureau of Contract Enforcement now refers to as "an embarrassing surplus of mortal souls cluttering up the processing centers†." The central principle that separates successful pact-makers from those currently spending eternity filing paperwork in triplicate is this: demons value blood not as a quaint symbolic gesture, but as a commodity with specific market valuations that fluctuate based on factors mortal economists find deeply troubling‡.

The principle of blood-as-currency dates to the First Infernal Exchange Rate Agreement**, negotiated in 1247 CE between the demon lord Baalzephon and the Venetian Banking Consortium††. Prior to this, demons accepted a bewildering array of payments including gold, firstborn children, the ability to enjoy music‡‡, and in one notable case, seventeen thousand wheels of cheese***. However, the standardization of blood currency revolutionized cross-planar commerce, establishing that one pint of freely given human blood possesses purchasing power roughly equivalent to 47 gold sovereigns, three minor political positions, or the secret to making bread that stays fresh for more than two days†††. The critical word in that sentence is "freely given" - blood extracted under duress trades at approximately one-eighth the value, a fact that has disappointed many would-be demon summoners who assumed their summoning circles were more intimidating than they actually were‡‡‡.

The second principle, which the Consortium for Infernal Legal Studies teaches in their mandatory first-year course "Why You Probably Shouldn't Do This****," concerns the reading and comprehension of contract terms. Demonic contracts are written in Infernal Script, a language that exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously and contains recursive legal clauses that reference paragraphs that don't exist yet††††. The average demonic pact contains 847 pages of terms and conditions‡‡‡‡, with the actual "sale of soul" clause typically appearing in footnote 1,294 of Appendix Q, subsection "Miscellaneous Surrenders of Eternal Essence*****." The Grand Archives of Cautionary Tales contain 3,764 documented cases of summoners who believed they were negotiating for power, wealth, or revenge, only to discover they had actually agreed to serve as the demon's accountant for the next three hundred years, with benefits††††† but no dental‡‡‡‡‡.

The third and most critical principle - never sign a demonic pact in your own blood - seems counterintuitive given that blood is the accepted currency******. However, the molecular structure of one's own blood contains what infernal legal theorists call "embedded consent protocols††††††," meaning that signing in your own blood doesn't just authorize the agreement, it authorizes the demon to make "reasonable amendments" to the contract terms‡‡‡‡‡‡. The definition of "reasonable" in Infernal Law includes anything that doesn't immediately cause the universe to collapse into a singularity, which gives demons considerable creative latitude*******. The recommended practice, established by the Guild of Survivors of Infernal Negotiations, is to sign using blood from a chicken†††††††, ideally one that has lived a good life and has no dependents who might object‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

Historical precedent demonstrates the catastrophic consequences of improper pact formation********, from the Incident at Salzburg********* in 1532, where an entire monastery accidentally traded their souls for what they believed was divine enlightenment but was actually a subscription to Demonic Quarterly Magazine††††††††, to the more recent Cambridge Miscalculation‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ of 1923, where a mathematics professor attempting to prove a theorem about infinite series instead proved that demons can count faster than humans and will absolutely use this advantage in contract negotiations**********. The fundamental lesson remains constant: treat infernal agreements with the same caution you would apply to lending money to relatives, accepting dinner invitations from strangers, or attempting to reason with administrative bureaucracy - which, according to the Daemonologie Comparativa, demons invented and then decided was too cruel even for Hell†††††††††.


*The Council of Concerned Family Members notes that demonic pacts have a 78.3% failure rate in this specific application, as demons find mortal family dynamics "incomprehensibly byzantine" compared to the straightforward hierarchies of the Infernal Realm.

†As of fiscal year 1842 (Hell operates on a different calendar), the backlog stands at approximately 847,293 souls awaiting processing. The demons have requested additional staffing, but Hell's HR department is, ironically, understaffed. See also: "The Bureaucracy Paradox: Why Hell's Administrative Systems Are Suspiciously Similar to Mortal Government Offices," Journal of Comparative Institutional Dysfunction, Vol. 34, Issue 7.

‡These factors include: phase of the moon, current market price of copper, number of active volcanoes, popularity of accordion music, and something the demons refer to as "the Ineffable Metric" which they refuse to explain because, they claim, mortals "wouldn't get it." The Demonic Commodities Exchange publishes daily rates, but they're written in a script that causes mild nausea in 73% of readers.

**This agreement came about after a Venetian banker accidentally summoned Baalzephon while trying to summon his accountant†. The demon, impressed by the complex financial instruments the Venetians had invented, proposed a formal exchange rate system. The original documents are kept in the Vatican's Secret Archives, in the section labeled "Financial Innovations We Definitely Didn't Get From Hell."

†The summoning circles were remarkably similar, differing only in that the accountant's circle required a compass and the demon's required a compass made of bone. The banker's apprentice had used the wrong shopping list.

††The Consortium consisted of twelve banking houses, three of which were later discovered to have been founded by demons in the first place††. This created a conflict of interest that modern regulatory bodies would find "troubling" if they knew about it, which they don't, which is probably for the best.

††A fact discovered only when auditors noticed that three of the Consortium members never aged, cast no shadows, and had expense reports that included line items for "brimstone maintenance." The resulting scandal was quickly suppressed, which is why you've never heard of it.

‡‡Musical appreciation was briefly considered one of the most valuable human commodities, until demons discovered that losing the ability to enjoy music also meant they couldn't be tortured by bad music, which removed one of their favorite damned-soul activities. The exchange rate crashed within a decade.

***The Cheese Incident of 1186, as it's known in demonic circles, involved a dairy farmer in Burgundy and a demon who really, really liked cheese‡‡. The demon got the cheese. The farmer got eternal youth but lost his sense of taste, which rendered his cheese-making skills somewhat irrelevant. The demon later admitted this was "perhaps not my finest negotiation."

‡‡Specifically Brie, aged at least six months. The demon's name was Caseus†††, which means "cheese" in Latin, which should have been a warning sign.

†††Not to be confused with Caseus the Scholar, Caseus the Unmerciful, or Caseus the Lactose Intolerant (who was cursed by a wizard and now exists as a cautionary tale about the importance of dietary disclosure in curse-casting).

†††This secret was later revealed to be "keep it in a sealed container." The market value of "obvious advice presented as arcane knowledge" is considerably lower than demons typically claim.

‡‡‡The Guild of Circle Drawers now recommends adding at least three symbols of warding, two backup containment rings, and one really stern facial expression. Success rate has improved to approximately 23%.

****Full title: "Why You Probably Shouldn't Do This: An Introduction to Infernal Contracts, Eternal Regret, and Alternative Career Paths." The course has a 94% dropout rate, which the faculty considers "encouraging," as it means 94% of students developed common sense. The remaining 6% go on to become either extremely powerful warlocks or cautionary tales. The ratio is approximately 1:47.

  description: `# Malevolent Bindings: Blood Curses and Their Mechanics

## A Practical Guide for the Ethically Flexible Practitioner

---

The establishment of a blood curse represents one of the most binding* and consequently hazardous† forms of malevolent magic known to modern thaumaturgical practice. Unlike simpler hexes or jinxes, which dissipate with time like morning dew or undergraduate enthusiasm‡, a properly constructed blood curse anchors itself to the victim's very essence through the sympathetic resonance of their vital fluid. The Council of Ethical Arcanists has, since the Incident of 1823**, maintained that blood curse casting should be restricted to those who have completed at least seven years of study††, passed the Advanced Karmic Mathematics examination‡‡, and can provide three character references from practicing wizards who are not currently serving time in any thaumaturgical correctional facility***. However, as Professor Earnest Wickwiddle of the Unseen University noted in his seminal work "Why Everything We Know Is Wrong And Also On Fire," the definition of "ethical" has varied considerably throughout history†††, particularly in regions where blood magic was considered a legitimate form of dispute resolution‡‡‡.

The fundamental requirement for blood curse establishment involves obtaining a sample of the target's blood****, or in cases where direct access proves difficult, blood from a close bloodline member†††† - preferably within three degrees of consanguinity, though the desperate have attempted it with more distant relatives‡‡‡‡. The blood acts as a metaphysical anchor, a thread connecting curse to cursed across distances both spatial and temporal*****. The precision required in the ritual cannot be overstated; the Gormenghast Institute for Advanced Wickedness maintains detailed records of 1,247 cases where improper blood preparation resulted in the curse affecting the caster instead of the intended target†††††, and a further 892 cases where it affected random bystanders within a three-mile radius‡‡‡‡‡. The curse's persistence is its defining characteristic - these bindings endure until their specific conditions are met, whether that be "until the seventh son of a seventh son performs the Dance of Propitiation at midnight on the winter solstice" or the more straightforward "until you apologize for eating my sandwich"******.

The karmic backlash of curse casting represents perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of this practice, primarily because most practitioners who experience it firsthand are either too dead or too transformed into small amphibians to file proper reports†††††††. The universe, it must be understood, maintains certain accounting standards‡‡‡‡‡‡, and malevolent magic accumulates on one's karmic ledger much like unpaid parking tickets - ignored at first, catastrophic in aggregate*******. The severity of backlash operates on what Professor Morbidezza Grimsnout termed the "Principle of Proportional Cosmic Annoyance"††††††††: a curse causing mild inconvenience might result in the caster experiencing acute toe-stubbing for six months‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, while a curse causing genuine suffering could manifest as anything from spontaneous combustion to finding oneself involuntarily employed by the Department of Thaumaturgical Revenue********. The ancient god-texts speak of curse-casters who accumulated such karmic debt that reality itself began returning their mail†††††††††, though modern scholars debate whether this should be interpreted literally or as an elaborate metaphor for social ostracism‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

The breaking of blood curses requires specific countermeasures that vary depending on the curse's construction, the phase of the moon at casting, and whether the original caster remembered to file Form 27B-6 with the Registry of Maleficent Workings*********. The most straightforward method involves fulfilling the curse's conditions, though as the case files from the Ankh-Morpork Guild of Curse-Breakers demonstrate, conditions like "when the mountains bow down" or "when ravens learn to sing opera" present certain practical difficulties††††††††††. Alternative approaches include sympathetic counter-rituals using the caster's own blood‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, the intervention of a more powerful practitioner willing to assume the karmic burden**********, or in desperate cases, petitioning the Old Powers who ruled before gods walked the earth - though this last option typically results in the curse being broken, the victim being free, and reality being slightly more crooked than it was before†††††††††††. The Department of Thaumaturgical Safety's official position remains that the best defense against blood curses is not having enemies with sufficient motivation, access to sharp objects, and poor impulse control‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, a position that has proven approximately 0.003% effective in preventing curse-related incidents over the past century***********.

\* Binding in both the magical and legal sense. The Morporkian Court of Thaumaturgical Torts ruled in *Ridcully v. That Bastard Who Cursed My Cow* that blood curses constitute a form of "persistent magical assault" and may be subject to damages. The case is still ongoing after 67 years.

† Hazardous is here defined as "likely to result in consequences ranging from mild karmic indigestion to being transformed into something that technically violates three or four fundamental laws of biology." The Guild of Curse-Casters maintains a helpful chart with pictographs for those who cannot read.

‡ For more on the dissipation rates of various hexes, see Grimsworth's "Decay Constants in Applied Malevolence," particularly Chapter 7: "Why Your Revenge Spell Probably Won't Last Until Tuesday."

\*\* The Incident of 1823 involved the entire village of Lesser Slaughtering deciding simultaneously to curse each other over a dispute about cheese. The resulting thaumaturgical cascade is why that part of the country now glows faintly purple on moonless nights and why the cows there speak in riddles.

†† Though as Professor Havelock Vetinari the Elder noted, "seven years" is flexible depending on whether one counts actual study or merely "being enrolled while engaging in other activities"†, such as drinking, practicing forbidden magic in dormitory rooms, or organizing elaborate pranks that violate the Third and Seventh Accords.

† The University of Krull attempted to formalize this distinction in 1756 but gave up when it became clear that approximately 89.7% of enrolled students fell into the latter category. They still charged full tuition.

‡‡ The Advanced Karmic Mathematics examination has a pass rate of 12.3%, primarily because Question 7 ("Calculate the karmic trajectory of a curse cast on a Tuesday when the caster has three outstanding moral debts and the target is having a particularly bad day already") has never been correctly answered. Those who come closest typically end up working for the Auditors.

\*\*\* Current statistics from the Überwaldean Council of Magical Oversight indicate that roughly 34% of practicing curse-casters have spent time in some form of magical correctional facility, 15% are currently wanted for questioning, and 3% are technically serving sentences but have achieved astral projection and continue practicing anyway. The remaining 48% are very good at not getting caught.

††† Professor Wickwiddle's work, while controversial, correctly identified that societies practicing regular blood feuds tended to view curse-casting as "just something people do, like farming or complaining about the weather." His field research in the Ramtops was cut short when he accidentally cursed himself while attempting to take notes.

‡‡‡ The village of Copperhead still maintains an annual Curse Festival, though it has been toned down considerably since the Regional Tourism Board insisted that "transforming visitors into livestock" was bad for business‡‡, regardless of how temporarily.

‡‡ The Board's official position was reached after the Incident of 1954, in which three busloads of tourists from Ankh-Morpork were transformed into chickens for the duration of a long weekend. The paperwork alone took six years to process.

\*\*\*\* Methods of obtaining said blood vary from the straightforward (asking politely, though this rarely works) to the elaborate (breaking into their home, bribing their barber, or attending the same family reunion and being very quick with small glass vials). The Guild of Assassins' handbook contains a surprisingly detailed chapter on blood acquisition that many curse-casters find useful, though the Guild insists this is "purely coincidental."

  description: `# Sanguine Sympathies: Tracking Through Blood Connections

## A Treatise on Hematomantic Location Practices and Their Societal Implications

The fundamental principle of blood sympathetic magic rests upon what the late Professor Hemlock Winterbourne termed "persistent corporeal resonance"*—the observable phenomenon that blood, once separated from its source, maintains a measurable thaumic connection to the body from which it originated. This connection, while diminishing over time at a rate proportional to approximately 3.7% per hour for the first seventy-two hours**, enables practitioners to locate the source individual with varying degrees of precision, ranging from "within shouting distance" to "somewhere on this particular continent, probably"***. The practice, while invaluable to concerned parents, emergency services, and the occasional bounty hunter†, raises considerable questions about personal autonomy and the right to not be located at inconvenient moments††.

The efficacy of blood tracking demonstrates a curious inverse relationship with temporal distance from the extraction event‡. Fresh blood—defined by the International Hematomantic Standards Board as blood removed from the body within the previous six hours‡‡—permits location accuracy to within seventeen feet, assuming optimal atmospheric conditions and a practiced hand‡‡‡. As the sample ages, the connection weakens in a manner Professor Winterbourne compared to "trying to remember where you left your keys, but the keys are a person, and the memory is in the blood, which sounds rather gruesome when stated plainly"†††. After approximately one week‡*, the connection becomes so attenuated as to be functionally useless, except for identifying which hemisphere the individual currently occupies, information which the truly desperate or sufficiently bored might find marginally useful‡**.

Perhaps most fascinating—and legally contentious—is the enhanced resonance observed when tracking blood relatives‡***. Family members share what Dr. Cordelia Sanguine termed "hereditary harmonic frequencies"***, permitting tracking at roughly 40% greater range and 60% improved accuracy compared to non-relatives**. This has led to what legal scholars call "the Grandmother Paradox"***—not to be confused with the temporal mechanics paradox of the same name—wherein elderly relatives possess a frankly disturbing ability to locate wayward grandchildren at precisely the moment said grandchildren are engaging in activities best left unwitnessed by family†*. The Ministry of Personal Privacy has logged exactly 47,839 complaints regarding this phenomenon in the past decade alone††*, though enforcement remains challenging given that most complainants are simultaneously grateful for and mortified by grandmaternal omniscience†**.

The privacy implications have not gone unnoticed by those with something to hide, leading to a robust market in countermeasures ranging from the practical to the preposterous†***. The most reliable method remains simple dilution‡†—rendering one's blood sufficiently mixed with other substances that the sympathetic connection becomes confused, much like trying to hear a whisper in a crowded tavern‡††. More elaborate solutions include the "Sanguine Shell Protocol" developed by the Reclusive Order of Hermits, which involves a complex ritual that Professor Winterbourne described as "unnecessarily theatrical but admittedly effective"‡‡†. The less said about the Veridian Solution*†, the better, given its classification by fourteen different magical governing bodies as "a Really Bad Idea, Seriously, Don't"*††.

The ethical framework surrounding blood tracking remains hotly debated in academic circles, with the Concordat of Personal Autonomy clashing regularly with the Alliance for Parental Peace of Mind*‡*. Current legislation in most civilized jurisdictions requires explicit consent for blood collection used in tracking purposes, with exceptions carved out for missing persons cases, medical emergencies, and what the law somewhat ambiguously terms "legitimate familial concern"*‡**. The definition of "legitimate" has spawned approximately 3,847 pages of legal commentary, six landmark court cases, and at least one minor diplomatic incident*‡***. As tracking magic continues to evolve, society must grapple with the eternal tension between safety and privacy, between knowing and not knowing, between the comfort of location and the freedom of being, occasionally, blissfully unfindable**†.

## Footnotes

*Professor Winterbourne's seminal work, "Blood Will Tell: And It Won't Shut Up About It," remains the definitive text on the subject, despite his unfortunate tendency to include extensive personal anecdotes about his digestive troubles. The academic community generally skips chapters 4, 7, and most of 11.

**This calculation assumes standard atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature between 15-25°C, and that nobody has sneezed on the sample. The effect of sneezing on thaumic resonance remains poorly understood, though the Guild of Fastidious Experimenters has allocated 4,500 gold sovereigns to find out†.

†They've been at it for six years. The research has been described as "thorough to the point of obsessive" and "possibly just an excuse to maintain funding." The lead researcher, Dr. Achoo Blessington, maintains that the work is vital††.

††Dr. Blessington has published 47 papers on the subject. Most repeat the same findings with slight variations in sneeze velocity.

***This measurement varies significantly based on whether the practitioner remembered to calibrate their thaumic compass that morning. The Guild of Blood Trackers estimates that approximately 34% of practitioners do not, leading to what they term "interpretive location results."

†The Bounty Hunter's Guild maintains the second-largest blood sample archive in the known world, surpassed only by the Overly Attached Family Members Support Group, which is less a support group and more a collective of people who've weaponized concern.

††Notable cases include the incident at the Meridian University's graduation party (Case File #1847-B), the Great Hide-and-Seek Championship of 1823 (wherein one participant remained hidden for six years before being located), and the unfortunate matter of Lord Pemberton's surprise birthday party, which remained a surprise for exactly forty-seven seconds after the blood-tracking invitation system activated.

‡The Board's meetings occur quarterly in the neutral city of Hemoglen, chosen specifically because no member nation can pronounce it correctly, thereby ensuring diplomatic equality through mutual linguistic inadequacy.

‡‡"Optimal atmospheric conditions" is defined as: humidity between 45-55%, barometric pressure of 1013.25 millibars (±5), no local thaumic interference, and—critically—no ongoing thunderstorms. Blood tracking during thunderstorms leads to what practitioners call "exciting misdirection" and what everyone else calls "ending up in the wrong country."

‡‡‡A "practiced hand" requires approximately 400 hours of supervised training, 200 hours of independent practice, and at least one incident of accidentally tracking oneself, which is more common than the Guild admits. The circular logic involved in tracking yourself while simultaneously being yourself has broken at least seven practitioners' minds. They're all fine now. Mostly†††.

†††They're not fine. They work in administration.

‡*Some blood types maintain connection longer than others. Type O-negative, being the universal donor, ironically becomes the universal evader, losing connection 23% faster than other types. Nature's little joke on those who can save everyone's life in an emergency but can't be tracked effectively afterward.

‡**The Hematomantic Standards Board maintains detailed charts showing exactly how useless various connection strengths are. Their most popular publication, "Degrees of Futility," includes the beloved category "Technically Still a Connection, But Why Bother?"

‡***Dark wizards particularly enjoy this detail, as it confirms that family reunions are indeed magically obligated to be inescapable. The correlation between hereditary tracking ability and family dinner attendance is 0.94, significant at p < 0.001.

  description: `BLOODLINE POWERS: INHERITED MAGICAL TRAITS THROUGH BLOOD

The inheritance of magical capacity through bloodlines represents one of the most extensively documented—and simultaneously misunderstood*—phenomena in arcane biology. For approximately four thousand years†, magical families have attempted to preserve their power through selective breeding, producing results ranging from "moderately successful" to "catastrophically inadvisable"‡. What has become increasingly clear through systematic study** is that magical inheritance operates on principles that directly contradict the intuitions of those most invested in the outcome††, namely, aristocratic families who have spent centuries doing precisely the wrong thing with remarkable consistency‡‡.

The recessive nature of certain magical traits means that powerful abilities may lay dormant for three, four, or even seven generations*** before manifesting in an individual who, to the complete bewilderment of their non-magical parents, suddenly develops the ability to summon flames with their mind at age thirteen†††. This phenomenon, known formally as "sudden onset thaumaturgical expression" and informally as "oh gods not again"‡‡‡, occurs when two carriers of dormant magical genes produce offspring****. The probability calculations are elegant in their mathematical precision and utterly useless for practical prediction, as evidenced by the fact that the Department of Magical Heredity employs seven full-time counselors whose sole function is to explain to disappointed parents why their child cannot, in fact, shoot lightning from their eyes despite both parents being able to do so*****. Pure bloodlines—those families who have maintained magical heritage through exclusive intermarriage—demonstrate a curious pattern: exceptional power in early generations followed by a gradual decline into what scholars politely term "diminished capacity" and what everyone else calls "the family curse"††††.

The awakening of dormant bloodline powers requires specific catalysts, though the literature is frustratingly vague on which catalysts produce which effects†. What is known is that emotional trauma, near-death experiences, and consuming foods prepared by one's grandmother all show statistically significant correlations with magical awakening‡‡‡‡, though obviously through entirely different mechanisms******. The process itself has been described as feeling like "remembering something you never learned" or "suddenly understanding a language you've never heard"*††, which is philosophically interesting but medically unhelpful. Contemporary awakening protocols developed by the Institute for Responsible Thaumaturgy****** emphasize controlled exposure to magical stimuli in monitored environments, a practice that has reduced catastrophic awakenings by 73.4% compared to the historical baseline of "waiting for something terrible to happen and hoping for the best"††††††.

The paradox of bloodline preservation through inbreeding represents perhaps the most thoroughly documented failure in magical history‡‡‡‡‡. While intuition suggests that concentrating magical genes through selective breeding should increase power, the reality proves devastatingly opposite*******. After approximately six generations of close intermarriage, magical families begin exhibiting what researchers call "thaumaturgical entropy": a progressive degradation of magical capacity accompanied by increasingly specific limitations on what magic can be performed††††††††. The House of Ethereus, for instance, spent nine hundred years breeding exclusively within their bloodline to preserve their legendary ability to command storms, and by the end could only produce a light drizzle, and only on Thursdays‡‡‡‡‡‡. Modern genetic studies have revealed that magical potency relies not on purity but on diversity—a finding that has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm by established magical families********, many of whom have spent centuries building their identity on being precisely wrong.

*The Compendium of Definitively Settled Magical Questions, first published in 1823, devoted 847 pages to bloodline inheritance. It has required seventeen major revisions, and counting. The eighteenth is currently being written by a committee of scholars who have stopped speaking to each other.

†Though accurate records only exist for the last 1,200 years. Prior to that, we have mostly fragments, contradictory accounts, and what appears to be someone's shopping list that was filed in the wrong archive††. The date 2000 BCE has been selected through a rigorous academic process involving several rounds of voting and one memorable fistfight.

††The list includes "three chickens, bread, cheese, possibly cursed amulet (check with Gerald), more bread." Gerald's opinion on the amulet's status remains unknown to history.

‡The Great Houses of the Fourth Epoch produced, among other achievements: seventeen documented cases of spontaneous combustion during family reunions, one individual who could only cast spells while standing on one leg, and the entire Bloodline of Seratic, who by 1647 had inadvertently bred themselves into being able to communicate exclusively through interpretive dance. They are still quite influential in certain artistic circles.

**The Longitudinal Study of Magical Heredity, conducted by the University of Umbral Sciences over 240 years, involved tracking 847 magical families across twelve generations. The researchers began with great optimism and ended with what their final report describes as "profound existential concern about the decision-making capacity of our species."

††A fact that has not stopped said families from insisting they understand bloodline magic better than the scholars who study it, thank you very much. The resulting arguments at academic conferences have become so reliably contentious that the venue now stocks extra chalk specifically for drawing elaborate insulting diagrams.

‡‡The House of Mordrin provides a representative example. They maintained detailed breeding records showing a clear pattern: Generation 1 could reshape matter with thought, Generation 6 could make small objects slightly warmer, and by Generation 11, the heir apparent could reliably predict when it would rain, but only by getting a headache first. They consider this "preserving their heritage."

***The record is thirteen generations, held by the Scattered Family of Northern Vael, whose magical lineage manifested again in 1891 when young Thomas Vael-Hendrickson discovered he could speak to ravens††. His great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather had possessed the same ability. The intervening generations had been entirely non-magical, which at least saved them from the awkwardness of explaining the family talent at social gatherings.

††The ravens reportedly found this as surprising as everyone else. Contemporary accounts suggest the ravens' initial response was largely unprintable.

†††The Guild of Concerned Parents maintains a hotline. It receives approximately 3,400 calls per year, though this number has been steadily declining as public education about magical inheritance has improved. The remaining calls are generally from families who skipped the educational pamphlets because "we don't need some government busybody telling us about magic, our family has known magic for generations," despite having no magical members for the past two hundred years.

‡‡‡A term coined by Matilda Graves, Head Counselor at the Department of Magical Heredity, after her 4,000th case. She was heard to mutter "oh gods not again" before even looking at the intake form, having developed an apparently supernatural ability to predict the nature of cases from the sound of approaching footsteps. Whether this constitutes its own form of magical inheritance remains under investigation.

****This is where aristocratic families tend to stop reading and start writing angry letters. The preservation of magical bloodlines, they argue, requires ensuring both parents carry the desired magical genes. This is technically true, but requires a definition of "desired" that includes "increasingly specific," "progressively limited," and "sometimes actively counterproductive."

*****The most common question received by these counselors is "But we can both do it, so why can't they?" followed closely by "Are you sure you're reading the results correctly?" and "I'd like to speak to your supervisor." The counselors maintain a betting pool on which question will come first. Current odds favor the supervisor request, particularly among families with multiple titles.

††††The Bloodline of Ancient Thross could once transmute lead into gold, summon lightning storms, and reportedly convinced gravity to take a day off in 1247‡. By 1803, the last pure-blooded member of House Thross could turn copper into a slightly shinier copper, and only if he really concentrated. He went into accounting.

‡Records suggest this was actually a localized magical catastrophe rather than a controlled demonstration, but the family has included it in their official history as evidence of their power. The fact that it killed eleven people and destroyed the entire west wing of their ancestral home is mentioned only in the footnotes, and then only if you read them very carefully.

‡‡‡‡A comprehensive study by the Institute for Improbable Statistics found that 34.7% of magical awakenings followed emotional trauma, 28.2% followed near-death experiences, and 19.8% followed consuming grandmother's cooking. The remaining 17.3% were attributed to "miscellaneous circumstances" including full moons`,
