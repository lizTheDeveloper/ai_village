  description: `# The Boundary Between: Detecting True Death

The determination of mortality status represents one of the most fundamental—and yet surprisingly controversial*—applications of basic magical sensing. While the layperson might assume that death is a binary state†, millennia of necromantic scholarship have demonstrated that the transition between life and death exists along a spectrum‡ of considerable metaphysical complexity. The ability to accurately detect true death is therefore not merely academic curiosity, but a practical necessity** that has prevented countless instances of premature burial††, inadvertent necromancy‡‡, and what the Guild of Morticians delightfully terms "awakening-related litigation."***

The primary indicator of true death is the distinctive void†† left by a departed soul. This absence registers to even moderately trained magical senses as a peculiar hollowness‡‡‡, not unlike the sensation of biting into what appears to be a chocolate only to discover it is, in fact, carob****. The soul's departure creates a metaphysical vacuum that cannot be replicated by unconsciousness, coma, or even the deepest meditative states employed by monks of the Stillness Monasteries†††. However—and this represents the central paradox that has confounded death-detection since the Age of Imprecise Determinations‡‡‡‡—brain death and soul departure do not always occur simultaneously*****. The soul may linger for hours, or in documented cases, days******, creating what Archmage Wiffleton termed "the most awkward waiting room in metaphysics."

Traditional methods of death detection, such as checking for breath, have proven unreliable to the point of comedy*******. The breath test fails to account for suspended animation†††††, extremely shallow breathing‡‡‡‡‡, temporary cessation spells******* used by overly committed Method actors, and the infamous "holding one's breath to win an argument" incident of 1742********. More problematically, certain undead retain respiratory functions purely out of habit†††††††—a fact that has led to numerous misdiagnoses and at least three recorded cases of zombies being released from morgues with a clean bill of health‡‡‡‡‡‡. The distinction between "mostly dead" and "all dead" is not, as commonly assumed, a matter of degree, but rather of fundamental categorical difference*********.

The practical application of death-detection magic requires attention to multiple simultaneous indicators**********. The competent practitioner must assess: the presence or absence of the soul; the state of the brain's magical resonance†††††††† (which dims but does not immediately cease); the condition of the body's ambient life-force‡‡‡‡‡‡‡; and the somewhat macabre but highly reliable "spectral displacement test,"********** in which nearby ghosts will maintain a respectful distance from the truly dead***********. When these factors align, death can be certified with 99.97% accuracy***********—a figure that represents a significant improvement over the mere 23% accuracy rate of medieval death-checkers, who relied primarily on poking the deceased with increasingly sharp sticks and hoping for a reaction.

In conclusion, the detection of true death remains an essential skill that bridges the divine and the diagnostic************. While technological advances have provided additional tools—the Mortimer Scale************, the Thanatos Resonance Detector††††††††††, and the simple but effective "ask them if they're dead" approach‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡—the fundamental magical principles outlined in this paper continue to form the basis of all reliable death determination. The boundary between life and death may be permeable, contested, and occasionally negotiable*************, but it can, with proper training and sufficient footnotes, be detected.

*The Third Synod of Necromancers (Responsible Division) spent eleven years debating whether death should be classified as a "state," "condition," "situation," or "predicament." They eventually settled on "it's complicated" and adjourned for lunch.

†This assumption proves fatal with remarkable regularity. The Guild of Morticians reports that approximately 1 in 847 "deceased" persons subsequently file complaints about premature burial preparations. The paperwork is apparently extensive.

‡The Spectrum of Mortality, as charted by the late (we think) Professor Grimwald, contains no fewer than forty-seven distinct gradations between "definitely alive" and "absolutely dead," including such exotic states as "pining," "resting," and "between engagements."

**The Necessity Coefficient, as calculated by the Institute for Measuring Things That Don't Need Measuring, rates death-detection as 94.3% necessary—lower than "not setting yourself on fire" (98.1%) but higher than "remembering where you put your keys" (87.6%).

††During the Dark Ages—so called because everyone kept the lights off to save on candles—approximately one in twenty-five persons was buried alive. The introduction of magical death-detection reduced this rate to approximately one in forty-seven thousand, though pessimists note this is still not zero†.

†According to the Premature Burial Prevention Society's annual reports, the remaining incidents are primarily caused by "didn't bother to check," "checked but got distracted by a really interesting bird," and "the deceased's mother-in-law insisted she was faking it."

‡‡The Accidental Necromancy Prevention Act of 1634 was passed after the incident at Lord Blackwood's estate, where what was intended as a simple resurrection spell instead created seventeen confused zombies and a very angry poltergeist. The subsequent lawsuit lasted longer than most of the participants' lives.

***The legal profession has benefited enormously from the ambiguous nature of death. The firm of Dewey, Deceased & Dewey specializes exclusively in post-mortem litigation. Their waiting room contains reading material from several centuries.

††The soul-void should not be confused with the soul-voice, soul-void, or Seoul, South Korea, despite common mispronunciations. One of these has excellent cuisine.

‡‡‡Described by the poet Marvonius the Melancholy as "the silence where a symphony should be," though he later admitted he was primarily thinking about his lunch when he wrote that.

****The Carob Comparison, first documented by Wizard-Confectioner Harriet Fudge, remains the single most universally understood metaphor in death-detection literature. Everyone has had the carob experience. Everyone remembers the disappointment.

†††The monks achieve heart rates of less than one beat per minute, leading to frequent incidents where worried visitors attempt to perform funeral rites on meditating abbots. The monasteries now post signs. The signs are frequently ignored.

‡‡‡‡So named after Professor Ambrose Fogworth's groundbreaking paper "Are You Dead Yet? A Longitudinal Study of Premature Determinations and the Subjects Who Objected to Them." The paper ran to 1,847 pages, mostly consisting of complaints.

*****The Record Holder for Delayed Soul Departure is currently Madame Esmeralda Persnikitty, whose soul remained in her body for three weeks after clinical brain death, during which time she won forty-seven games of cards against increasingly unnerved opponents and wrote a strongly worded letter to the Times about the state of modern death certificates. Her soul finally departed mid-sentence, which her daughter noted was "very on-brand."

******The average delay is 4.3 seconds. The standard deviation is considerable.

*******The Great Breath-Checking Disaster of 1423 resulted in seventeen premature burials, three delayed funerals, and the founding of the Guild of Death-Checkers, whose motto is "Measure Twice, Bury Once." They maintain excellent records of their failures, which are displayed in their headquarters as "educational opportunities."

††††††Suspended animation, as practiced by assassins, spies, and overly cautious travelers, involves reducing all vital signs to undetectable levels. The technique was pioneered by the legendary assassin Barely There, who once spent three weeks in a morgue gathering intelligence. He rated the experience "two stars, would not recommend."

‡‡‡‡‡Some meditation masters can reduce their breathing to once per hour. They are very boring at parties.

*******The Method Acting Guild's spell allows practitioners to "really feel" death for up to six hours. After the incident where celebrated actor Thaddeus Hamm spent a week in a coffin because nobody wanted to interrupt his "process," the spell was restricted to licensed professionals and people who really, really know what they're doing.

********Lord Pemberton the Stubborn maintained he was right about the pronunciation of "gif" (hard g). His butler maintained his lordship was wrong. They had a bet. Lor`,

  description: `THE MOMENT OF SEVERANCE: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOULS LEAVE BODIES

The transition between animate corporeal existence and whatever comes after* represents one of the most studied yet least understood phenomena in thanatological metaphysics. Current consensus among the Guild of Death Scholars† suggests that the soul—that ineffable essence that separates a living being from an extremely sophisticated meat puppet‡—does not depart instantaneously at the moment commonly referred to as "death," but rather through a process lasting between three and seven minutes††, during which it remains connected to the physical form via what practitioners term the "silver cord."*** This attachment period explains numerous documented phenomena including the infamous Kettering Incident of 1847†††, last-minute recoveries that physicians find deeply embarrassing‡‡, and the particularly awkward case of Lord Pemberton who woke up during his own funeral‡‡‡.

The mechanism of departure varies significantly depending on the nature of death itself, a distinction that becomes critically important for practitioners of necromantic intervention****. Peaceful deaths—those occurring in bed, surrounded by loved ones, with all affairs properly settled and no unfinished business more pressing than a half-completed crossword††††—typically result in what researchers call a "clean severance," wherein the soul departs smoothly along established metaphysical pathways‡‡‡‡, often pausing only to check if it left the oven on. Violent deaths, conversely, produce what the Mortimancer's Handbook****** describes as "metaphysical whiplash," causing the soul to ricochet off the spiritual substrate like a stone skipping across water†††††, sometimes taking several attempts before successfully departing‡‡‡‡‡. The Department of Existential Statistics reports that approximately 73.4% of violent deaths result in at least one "false start," while 12.8% involve what can only be described as the soul frantically looking for the exit in a dark theater*******.

The phenomenon of lingering souls—commonly, if somewhat insensitively, referred to as "ghosts"********—occurs when the severance process fails to complete properly. Contributing factors include unfinished business†††††††, strongly held beliefs about the afterlife that turn out to be administratively inconvenient‡‡‡‡‡‡, architectural features that inadvertently trap souls like spiritual flypaper*********, or simply a stubborn refusal to accept the inevitable**********, which is, in fairness, a very human quality to maintain even after ceasing to be human. The Old University maintains a Department of Spectral Psychology† that has documented precisely 847 distinct reasons why souls refuse to depart††††††††, ranging from the profound to the ridiculous‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, with "wanting to see how the story ends" representing a statistically significant 8.3% of cases***********.

For necromancers and other professionals in the death-adjacent industries, understanding the window of opportunity for intervention proves essential. The silver cord period represents the sole timeframe during which resurrection, forced reanimation, or soul-binding can occur with any reasonable chance of success††††††††† and without catastrophic consequences‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. After the cord severs, attempting to recall a soul becomes exponentially more difficult, requiring power levels that tend to attract unwanted attention from both civil authorities and entities best left undisturbed***********. The Guild publishes annually updated guidelines that strongly emphasize the importance of timing, proper permissions, and having a very good lawyer************.


*Philosophers have been arguing about this "whatever comes after" for approximately 47,000 years, give or take several millennia, without reaching any consensus whatsoever. The Eternal Debate Society of Upper Quirmingham has been in continuous session since 1203 CE discussing this exact question. They're currently stuck on whether the afterlife has adequate parking.

†Founded in 1734 by the delightfully named Professor Mortimer Gravely-Serious, who tragically died before completing his seminal work "On The Experience Of Dying: A Practical Guide." His last words were reportedly "Well, this is inconvenient timing."

‡See footnote ††† for why calling bodies "meat puppets" is technically accurate but will get you thrown out of most funeral homes.

††This range accounts for variables including but not limited to: body mass, spiritual density, weather conditions, proximity to ley lines, whether Mercury is in retrograde*, unresolved emotional baggage, and the phase of the moon. The Celestial Institute of Temporal Thanatology attempted to create a precise formula but gave up after the equation required seventeen pages and introduced imaginary numbers.

*The influence of Mercury's position on soul departure is highly debated. The Astronomical Society insists it has no effect whatsoever. The Astrological Society insists it has tremendous effect. Both societies stopped speaking to each other in 1689 and communicate only through increasingly passive-aggressive journal publications.

***Early researchers believed it to be literally silver, leading to the Unfortunate Prospecting Incident of 1802 in which several entrepreneurial necromancers attempted to mine freshly deceased bodies for precious metals. They were disappointed, prosecuted, and in one case, haunted.

†††In which seventeen people "died" simultaneously during a particularly exciting cricket match (final score: 347 to 12, in case you were wondering), but all recovered after approximately five minutes when it became clear their team might actually win. The Medical Journal of Improbable Occurrences lists this under "Deaths, Premature, Psychosomatic, and Embarrassing."

‡‡The Medical Council of 1876 attempted to have the official time of death extended to ten minutes after cessation of heartbeat, specifically to reduce these awkward situations. The motion failed by a single vote after Dr. Pemberton pointed out this would require redoing vast amounts of paperwork.

‡‡‡Lord Pemberton (no relation to Dr. Pemberton, though they did meet at a symposium once and the conversation was reportedly very stilted) was pronounced dead after a riding accident in 1823. He recovered consciousness approximately eight minutes later, mid-eulogy, and lived another forty-three years. He spent most of them correcting people who said "you look well for someone who died." His autobiography, "Premature: A Memoir," became an unexpected bestseller.

****Necromancy has suffered from unfortunate public relations ever since the Reanimation Mishaps of the 1650s, when several practitioners took "intervention" to mean "raising armies of the undead to settle property disputes." The Guild now requires licensing, liability insurance, and a very thorough background check.

††††The Ancient Guild of Crossword Constructors maintains this is the leading cause of hauntings in the newspaper industry. The Ghost of Pending Publications Committee investigated and found this claim to be 67% accurate, though they noted most of these hauntings resolved themselves once someone else completed the crossword in question. Using pen, preferably.

‡‡‡‡These pathways were mapped by the legendary thanatologist Esperanza Darkwater† in 1456, using what she called "voluntary astral projection" and what the Church called "extremely concerning behavior." Her maps remain the standard reference, despite being drawn from memory and including several locations that appear to be coffee shops.

†Not to be confused with the pirate Esperanza Darkwater who terrorized the Circular Sea in 1689, though family histories suggest they might have been cousins.

******Written by the incomparable Madame Yaga Bonesworth in 1712, this tome remains required reading despite its tendency to spontaneously combust when opened by the insufficiently qualified. Current edition includes asbestos page protectors.

†††††The technical term is "traumatic metaphysical displacement." Souls hate it. The process has been described as "extremely disorienting," "rather like being sneezed out of existence," and in one memorable testimony from a temporarily-resurrected witness, "absolutely rubbish."

‡‡‡‡‡Historical records indicate that Emperor Claudius the Confused (982-1043 CE) took sixteen attempts to successfully depart, spending three weeks as a somewhat corporeal ghost criticizing the interior decoration choices of his successor. He eventually left after they agreed to repaint the throne room.

*******This statistic comes from the exhaustive study "Souls in Darkness: A Comprehensive Survey of Violent Death Metaphysics" published by the Institute of Morbid Research in 1923. The remaining 13.8% involves cases too disturbing, too complicated, or too ridiculous to publish. The unpublished files are kept in a vault that requires three separate keys, held by three separate people who have been instructed never to meet.

  description: `PREVENTING DECAY: THE NECROMANCER'S GUIDE TO CORPSE MAINTENANCE

The fundamental challenge facing the practicing necromancer is not, as commonly supposed, the moral implications of disturbing the dead*, but rather the prosaic problem of keeping them presentable. A corpse, left to its own devices, will proceed through the stages of decomposition with what can only be described as unseemly haste†. The average human body, at room temperature, becomes significantly less cooperative after approximately 48-72 hours‡, though this timeline varies based on ambient conditions, the deceased's final meal, and whether they died on a Tuesday‡‡. This presents the necromancer with a window of optimal workability that is, frankly, inconvenient for anyone not already maintaining a fully-stocked laboratory.

The two primary schools of preservation divide along familiar lines: the Thermomantic Approach favors magical refrigeration*, while the Chemomantic Tradition champions various forms of chemical embalming**. The former requires sustained magical effort and the latter requires access to substances that tend to raise questions at customs††. Both methods slow the natural processes of decay, though neither entirely prevents the gradual accumulation of what the Guild of Mortuary Sciences delicately terms "structural compromise"†††. Fresh corpses remain the gold standard for reanimation work, responding to necromantic commands with approximately 73% greater alacrity than preserved specimens‡‡‡. The reasons for this remain debated, though most scholars agree it relates to the degradation of the ethereal connections between body and departing soul§.

The traditional preservatives—salt, mercury, and arsenic—have sustained the necromantic arts since the Third Age§§, though their use requires considerable care. Salt draws out moisture while maintaining tissue integrity, mercury prevents bacterial activity through means best not examined too closely§§§, and arsenic does something that no one quite understands but which definitely works****. The correct ratios were established by the legendary necromancer Valdus the Meticulous, who tested 847 different combinations before discovering the optimal formula††††. Modern practitioners benefit from his extensive documentation, though it should be noted that Valdus himself was eventually preserved using his own methods, and opinions differ on how well that turned out‡‡‡‡.

The relationship between decay and magical resistance presents the necromancer with a cruel paradox: the more preserved the corpse, the less responsive it becomes to reanimation§§§§. This suggests that some degree of "aliveness"—though that term requires significant philosophical unpacking—remains necessary for proper necromantic function. The optimal preservation state, according to measurements taken by the Institute of Applied Necromancy*****, maintains the corpse at what they term "Stage One Plus": visibly deceased but structurally sound, with minimal bloating and no significant loss of articulation. This state can be maintained for approximately three to six weeks with proper care†††††, after which even the most powerful necromancer will find their subject increasingly argumentative‡‡‡‡‡.

For the apprentice necromancer, the lesson is clear: plan ahead, maintain proper cold storage§§§§§, and never, under any circumstances, attempt to reanimate anything that has been sitting in the sun for a fortnight******. The technical difficulties alone should dissuade you, but if they do not, consider the social ramifications. The Guild has been quite explicit about this††††††.

---

*Though these remain considerable. The Ethical Committee of the Necromancers' Guild produced a 1,847-page report on the subject in 1673, which concluded, essentially, "Yes, it's problematic, but we're doing it anyway." The report is required reading for all certified practitioners.

†The precise rate of decomposition follows what the Bureau of Mortuary Statistics calls the "Alarming Acceleration Principle." A corpse at 20°C (68°F) will progress through Stage One (fresh) in 24-48 hours, Stage Two (bloat) in 48-96 hours, and thereafter proceed with what senior examiner Helda Grimsworth described as "frankly unseemly enthusiasm."

‡This is according to the foundational text "On the Temperament of the Recently Deceased" by Magister Cornelius Rot, published in 1432. Cornelius was notably obsessed with precision and once spent three years measuring decay rates under different moon phases.

‡‡The Tuesday phenomenon remains unexplained, though the Guild suspects it relates to the ancient god Tiu's particular distaste for necromancy. Corpses that expire on a Tuesday demonstrate 12% faster decay rates and 8% higher resistance to reanimation. The statistical significance has been confirmed by seventeen independent studies, but no one has successfully determined why. One researcher, Dr. Millicent Graves††, suggested that perhaps Tiu was "just being spiteful."

††Dr. Graves disappeared in 1789 under mysterious circumstances. Her laboratory was found empty except for a note reading "Gone to ask Him directly." She has not been seen since, though several mediums claim to have contacted her spirit, which reportedly spent the entire séance complaining about "divine middle management."

*The refrigeration spell, properly termed Gelidus Mortificus, requires maintaining a temperature between 2-4°C around the corpse. This consumes approximately 47 magical units per day for an average-sized human body†, making it expensive for extended storage. The spell also tends to cause frost buildup on nearby surfaces, leading to the distinctive "frozen tears" effect that marks most working necromantic laboratories.

†Magical unit measurements were standardized by the Council of Thaumaturgical Weights and Measures in 1556, following the chaos of the Unit Wars (1547-1555), during which at least six different measurement systems competed for dominance. The current standard defines one magical unit as "the amount of energy required to levitate a standard cheese one meter for one minute." The choice of cheese was itself controversial†† and is still debated.

††The Standard Cheese, kept in a vault beneath the Council headquarters in Arkham, is a wheel of aged cheddar weighing exactly 1.2 kilograms. It has been replaced seventeen times due to theft, decay, and one incident in 1702 that no one discusses. The current Standard Cheese dates from 1891 and is guarded by three sphinxes who ask really quite difficult riddles.

**Chemical embalming traces its lineage to the ancient Nectarian Empire, where preservation of the royal dead was considered both art and sacred duty. The Nectarian formula, recorded on the Tablet of Eternal Rest†, combined natron, cedar oil, and something they called "blessed nightshade" which modern analysis suggests was actually a mixture of arsenic and wishful thinking. The formula worked, however—Emperor Nektaris VII has been successfully reanimated four times over the past two thousand years, though he reports the experience as "increasingly unpleasant."

†The Tablet of Eternal Rest was discovered in 1823 by the archaeologist Sir Reginald Tomb-Raiders (yes, really). Sir Reginald immediately attempted to use the formula on his late wife, resulting in what the Royal Society's incident report described as "a regrettable excess of enthusiasm and a catastrophic misunderstanding of volumetric ratios." Lady Tomb-Raiders was eventually laid to rest again after the third resurrection attempt, and Sir Reginald was politely asked to pursue other interests.

††The Black Market Price Index for Suspicious Preservatives lists current rates for "totally legitimate embalming supplies, honest guv." Mercury runs approximately 47 gold pieces per liter, arsenic 23 gold pieces per kilogram (with a bulk discount for quantities that really should trigger an investigation), and salt is, thankfully, quite affordable. The Index is published quarterly by an organization that insists it does not exist and threatens legal action against anyone who suggests otherwise.

†††"Structural compromise" encompasses a range of conditions from "slightly soft" to "soup." The Guild's Classification System for Deceased Integrity (CSDI) runs from Grade 1 (freshly deceased, excellent condition) to Grade 9 (theoretical presence only). Most necromantic work requires minimum Grade 4, though desperate practitioners have attempted Grade 6 reanimations with results best described as "unfortunate" and "difficult to clean up."

‡‡‡This statistic comes from Dr. Erasmus Bones' landmark study "Comparative Responsiveness in Fresh versus Preserved Cadaveric Material" (1734), which tested 200 corpses under controlled conditions. The study was controversial, not for its methodology, but for Dr. Bones' insistence on including a control group of "really quite alive volunteers" to establish baseline responsiveness. The Ethics Committee rejected his application seventeen times before he gave up and moved to the Disputed Territories, where ethical oversight is more of a suggestion.`,

  description: `THE FINAL EXHALATION: HARVESTING ENERGY FROM THE DYING

The moment of death, that liminal instant when consciousness departs its mortal vessel, has long been recognized by practitioners of the necromantic arts as a phenomenon of considerable energetic significance*. What the layperson experiences as a solemn or tragic moment, the trained observer recognizes as a measurable discharge of what the Akademie für Zwischenwelten Terms und Conditions has termed "thanatic potential energy"†—a burst of power that, if properly captured, can fuel magical workings of surprising potency**. This release, colloquially known among practitioners as the "death burst," represents the sudden liberation of the binding energies that maintain the soul's attachment to physical form, creating what Dr. Erasmus Kettleblack famously described as "a window of opportunity approximately 3.7 seconds wide, during which the universe forgets to lock the back door"††.

The magnitude of this energetic discharge varies considerably depending upon the circumstances of death***. Natural deaths—those resulting from age, disease, or what insurance adjusters term "acts of God that God really should have thought twice about"—produce a relatively modest energy yield, typically between 45 and 120 thaums‡. This is because the dying process in such cases occurs gradually, with the soul's departure resembling less a dramatic exodus and more a slow leak‡‡, allowing energy to dissipate across an extended timeframe rather than releasing catastrophically all at once. Violent or sudden deaths, by contrast, can generate up to 800 thaums‡‡‡—a discharge so potent that untrained observers have been known to experience what the medical literature euphemistically calls "unintentional minor lichdom"§. The Guild of Mortuary Practitioners maintains that this differential exists not because the universe has a morbid sense of theater, but simply because surprise deaths catch the soul unprepared, causing it to exit through the nearest available metaphysical aperture with considerable force§§.

The ethical considerations surrounding the practice of deliberately attending deaths for the purpose of energy harvesting have been debated since at least the Third Conclave of Arguably Reasonable Necromancers in 1743§§§, where the assembled practitioners voted 47 to 3 (with 12 abstentions and 2 who claimed to have been dead at the time) to establish guidelines for "ethically uncomfortable but potentially quite useful observational practices"*. The primary concern, as outlined in the Conclave's resulting treatise, is not the harvesting itself—the energy exists whether collected or not—but rather the potential for what the document delicately terms "premature encouragement of the harvesting opportunity"**. Modern practitioners follow the Kettleblack Principles†, which require that one must: (a) have legitimate cause to be present††, (b) make no action to hasten the inevitable‡, (c) maintain appropriate solemnity despite the significant power rush‡‡, and (d) file the proper paperwork with the Mortuary Guild within three business days‡‡‡.

The practice known as "death watching," wherein necromancers maintain vigils at the bedsides of the dying specifically to observe and measure the thanatic discharge, occupies a peculiarly uncomfortable space in both magical and mundane society§. While hospice workers generally maintain that having someone present during death is comforting to the dying§§, they tend to become significantly less enthusiastic when that someone is taking notes, muttering calculations, and positioning crystal matrices around the bed§§§. The Guild of Professional Death Watchers—an organization whose existence most necromancers publicly deny while privately maintaining their membership dues—publishes an annual directory of individuals likely to expire within the calendar year*, along with projected energy yields and recommended observation positions**. This has led to what the Ankh-Morpork City Watch terms "competitive deathbed lurking"††, wherein multiple practitioners attempt to secure prime observational real estate around particularly powerful dying individuals, occasionally resulting in scenes that would be comedic if they weren't occurring around someone's grandmother‡‡.

Contemporary research into thanatic energy harvesting has focused primarily on improving capture efficiency without requiring physical presence at the death itself§, thereby resolving many of the ethical complications that have plagued the field since its inception. The Broken Circle Laboratory has developed a series of "sympathetic collection matrices" that can be attuned to an individual while they're still healthy§§, allowing the eventual death burst to be partially redirected to a prepared vessel regardless of distance§§§. Early results suggest approximately 23% of the death energy can be captured through this method—less than direct observation, but enough to power moderate spellwork and significantly reduce the social awkwardness of explaining to bereaved relatives why you're standing in the corner with a notebook and what appears to be a very eager expression*. The ethical review board has tentatively approved this approach, noting that "at least this way they're not actually in the room when it happens, which is something"**.


FOOTNOTES:

* The recognition dates back considerably further than formal necromantic study. Ancient tomb inscriptions from the Third Dynasty include phrases that translate roughly as "went out with a bang" and "left the lights on," suggesting early observers noted something unusual occurred at death. Though whether they meant energetic discharge or simply that Uncle Rasheed had refused to close his eyes is subject to some archaeological debate.

† Not to be confused with the Akademie's other prominent coinage, "pre-thanatic potential energy," which refers to the energy inherent in still-living beings and is technically just "being alive." The Committee on Unnecessary Terminology Creation has been very productive.

** Kettleblack's original paper on the subject was titled "On the Brief but Profitable Moment Between Having a Soul and Not Having One," which the journal editors found insufficiently academic. The revised title, "Observations on Thanatic Energy Discharge Phenomena," was deemed sufficiently boring to be taken seriously. Kettleblack complained about this until his own death in 1847, which, ironically, produced one of the most carefully measured death bursts in recorded history†.

†† His students had been prepared for this eventuality for approximately fifteen years. They drew straws. The winner got to do the measurements while the losers had to comfort his sobbing relatives‡.

‡ Though "comfort" might be strong. One student's field notes, preserved in the Unseen University archives, include the phrase "told them the reading was excellent, which did not help."

*** The Thanatic Energy Research Society publishes annual statistics on death energy yields, broken down by cause of death, age, species, time of day, and—controversially—astrological sign. Their methodology section is longer than most doctoral dissertations and contains seventeen separate acknowledgments of statistical improbability.

‡ For comparison, this is approximately enough energy to: light a modest room for three hours, levitate a cat for forty-five seconds, or reanimate a small amphibian for reasons the literature suggests you probably shouldn't†.

† The Incident at the Society for the Advancement of Small Amphibians' annual dinner is still not discussed in polite necromantic circles. Suffice it to say that forty-seven temporarily reanimated toads appearing in the soup course created what the Society's minutes describe as "a regrettable disturbance" and what everyone else describes as "Tuesday's trauma."

‡‡ Dr. Wilhelmina Sackbutt-Farnsworth's treatise "On the Gradual Dimming" compares natural death to a candle burning down versus a candle being shot with a crossbow. The metaphor becomes somewhat confused in later chapters when she begins discussing what happens if you shoot a burning candle with a crossbow while someone dies nearby, but the experimental methodology was at least thorough.

The record holder remains Sir Humphrey Bragstock, who in 1592 achieved 1,247 thaums upon realizing mid-fall that the spell he'd cast was "feather fall" and not "feather mall," the latter being a shopping district in the Agatean Empire that he had somehow successfully summoned to a position directly between himself and the ground.

One reportedly turned invisible, another sprouted wings, and a third somehow summoned his dead grandmother, who was reportedly quite cross about being interrupted.

  description: `# A Classification of Undead: From Zombies to Liches

The phenomenon of undeath presents what the late Professor Mortimer Gravely* termed "a taxonomy of inconvenience," wherein the classification system must account for the presence or absence of two fundamental components: the corporeal vessel and the animating soul†. The Guild of Mortuary Sciences‡ has, after considerable debate** and three separate workplace incidents††, established a four-fold classification system that addresses all known varieties of ambulatory deceased‡‡. This system, while academically sound***, proved surprisingly difficult to implement in the field†††, particularly when attempting to determine whether one should run screaming or attempt diplomatic negotiation‡‡‡.

The first category encompasses those unfortunate§ individuals who possess both their original body and soul—the so-called "intelligent undead"§§. Liches and vampires fall into this classification, having achieved undeath through deliberate magical intervention§§§ rather than the more common accident◊ or malicious curse◊◊. These entities retain their personality, memories, and—most troublingly—their capacity for long-term planning◊◊◊. The key distinguishing feature is their ability to hold grudges★, pass legislation★★, and, in at least one documented case, successfully petition for tax-exempt status★★★. They are, in essence, people who happen to be dead, with all the complications that implies†*.

The second category comprises bodies without souls: zombies, skeletons, and other mindless servants†† that shamble about performing tasks with the efficiency of a particularly poorly-designed committee††*. These unfortunates retain neither personality nor initiative‡*, existing merely as ambulatory meat‡‡* or bone§* operated through external magical control§§*. The Handbook of Practical Necromancy§§§* recommends treating them much as one would treat any other tool: store them properly, oil the joints◊*, and never, under any circumstances, leave them unsupervised near populated areas◊◊*.

The third category—souls without bodies—presents the ghostly host of wraiths, spectres, and common hauntings◊◊◊*. These entities★† exist in a state that Professor Etherealia Whisperwind★†† described as "rather like being a strongly-worded letter that refuses to be delivered."★††† They possess consciousness, memory, and often considerable emotional investment in terrestrial affairs‡†, yet lack the physical means to directly influence the material world§† without expending considerable effort§††. The fourth and final category defies intuitive classification entirely: death knights◊† and similar constructs that possess neither their original body nor soul, but rather operate on what the Department of Paradoxical Entities◊†† terms "sheer narrative momentum."◊††† These represent not resurrection but rather magical fabrication★‡, corpses worn like elaborate suits by animating enchantments‡‡ that have developed something uncomfortably close to consciousness§‡.

Understanding these distinctions proves essential for both theoretical study and practical survival§‡‡, as the appropriate response to encountering undead varies dramatically by category◊‡. Misidentification has led to numerous regrettable incidents◊‡‡, from the overly aggressive★§ to the catastrophically polite★§§. The wise practitioner therefore masters identification before attempting any form of interaction★§§§, ideally from a considerable distance†‡ using high-quality observational equipment††‡ and with a clear escape route†††‡ already mapped.

## FOOTNOTES

*Professor Gravely (1823-1847, 1847-present) achieved his own undeath quite by accident while attempting to prove that lich transformation was "theoretically impossible." He maintains his chair at the University of Deathhampton to this day, though his lectures have become notably more sarcastic since his transformation. His autobiography, "I Was Wrong: A Memoir," remains unpublished at his insistence.

†The soul, as established in prerequisite reading on soul departure mechanics, traditionally exits the body upon death. Getting it to come back, or preventing it from leaving in the first place, requires considerable magical effort and paperwork. The Bureau of Soul Management processes approximately 47,000 applications annually, of which roughly 0.003% are approved. The rest are stamped "DENIED—SEE ATTACHED REASONS" and returned with stern letters about the natural order.

‡Founded in 1602 following what historians refer to only as "The Summer of Unfortunate Reanimations." The Guild's motto, "Mortuus Sed Adhuc Molestus" (Dead But Still Annoying), reflects a pragmatic approach to undeath studies.

**The Great Vampire-or-Lich Debate of 1784 lasted three weeks and concluded only when both example specimens became irritated enough to attend the conference personally and settle the matter. The resulting paper, "Primary Source Testimony in Undeath Classification," remains the field's most-cited work, though largely because the authors—being undead themselves—were able to pursue citations with unprecedented aggression.

††Two involved misidentified specimens. The third involved a graduate student who insisted on testing the "mindless zombie" classification by asking increasingly philosophical questions until the specimen became confused and fell down a well. The student received a commendation for innovative methodology and a stern warning about well safety.

‡‡Though the vampire representative, Lord Sanguine, contested the term "ambulatory deceased," preferring "alternately metabolized." His motion was defeated 47-3, with two abstentions and one ballot that appeared to be covered in suspicious stains.

***Academically sound but practically complex. The field identification guide runs to 247 pages, most of which consist of decision trees that begin with "Are you currently being chased?" and branch into increasingly unhelpful territory.

†††Field researchers reported that undead creatures rarely cooperate with classification attempts. The standard approach of "politely asking" proved effective only 12% of the time, and only then with the intelligent varieties who found the exercise amusing.

‡‡‡The Mortuary Guard's motto remains "When in doubt, assess from a distance." Their casualty rate dropped by 73% after this policy was officially adopted.

§Professor Emeritus Cadavria Deathwhisper argues that "unfortunate" implies these individuals didn't pursue undeath deliberately, which overlooks the growing population of voluntary liches. Her paper "Stop Calling Us Unfortunate: A Lich's Perspective" makes several compelling points, though reviewers noted it was "unnecessarily hostile" and "somewhat threatening."

§§A term they themselves prefer to the more common "smart zombies" or "the ones who plan things," both of which were rejected by the Undead Rights Coalition as "reductive and insulting."

§§§The phylactery-binding ritual for lich transformation requires 47 separate components, takes six months to complete, and has a 23% success rate. The 77% failure rate generally results in death, which applicants find ironic given that death was rather the point. Survivors of failed attempts often pursue careers in life insurance sales.

◊The most common form of accidental undeath involves improper disposal of cursed artifacts, usually by individuals who thought "what's the worst that could happen?" The answer, maintained in careful records by the Department of Regrettable Curiosity, is "zombification, 34% of cases; vampirism, 28%; spontaneous haunting, 23%; other, 15%."

◊◊The Compendium of Curses lists 1,847 varieties that can result in undeath. Number 1,263, "The Curse of the Unpaid Tab," originated in taverns and remains surprisingly common. Number 442, "The Critic's Comeuppance," specifically targets theatrical reviewers and was banned by international treaty in 1823.

◊◊◊Lady Vladislava the Eternal notes in her memoirs that strategic planning becomes considerably easier when one has centuries to implement schemes. She successfully manipulated three separate kingdoms into war, waited 80 years for the political situation to develop, then swooped in to purchase the resulting wastelands at fire-sale prices. Her investment portfolio is considered exemplary by the Undead Business Association.

★The Vampire Council maintains a "List of Grievances" dating back to 1347. Items include "garlic in public spaces," "unflattering portraiture," and "that incident with the mirrors." The list grows by approximately 15 entries per year, suggesting that grudge-retention is indeed eternal.

★★The Lich Parliament of Lower Mortavia has been in continuous session since 1552. They have successfully passed three bills: one standardizing phylactery safety regulations, one establishing Tuesdays as "No Resurrection Day" for administrative efficiency, and one declaring that`,
