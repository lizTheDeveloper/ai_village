  description: `POINTING LIGHT VERY ANGRILY: THE FUNDAMENTALS OF LASER WEAPONS

The fundamental principle of laser weaponization can be expressed with disappointing simplicity: concentrate sufficient photons in a small enough area for a long enough time, and matter begins to object strenuously to its current state of being*. The acronym LASER—Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation—sounds impressively technical, which is fortunate, because "making light very cross and pointing it at things" tested poorly with the Department of Defense†. The journey from laboratory curiosity to handheld weapon system requires solving approximately 847 engineering problems**, of which 846 involve heat, and one involves explaining to your institution's ethics board why you need liability insurance that covers "accidental sublimation of grad students."

The critical metric for laser weaponization is power density, typically measured in watts per square centimeter, though the Federated Guild of Experimental Weaponeers prefers "screams per second"††. A common household laser pointer delivers approximately 5 milliwatts across a 3mm beam, which is sufficient to annoy cats and absolutely nothing else***. To achieve weapon-grade destructive capacity, one must increase this by a factor of roughly one million, which turns out to be harder than simply attaching a million laser pointers together‡. The mathematical relationship is brutally straightforward: more power equals more destruction equals more heat equals more problems‡‡. The optimistic researcher believes they can simply add cooling fins; the experienced researcher has already filed the insurance claim†††.

Heat dissipation represents the fundamental limitation of portable laser weapon systems, a fact demonstrated most memorably by Dr. Helena Farthingworth's prototype "Photonic Annihilator" of 1973‡‡‡, which successfully generated a 50-kilowatt beam for approximately 0.3 seconds before achieving what the incident report diplomatically termed "catastrophic thermal runaway§". The laws of thermodynamics, it transpires, are less like guidelines and more like cosmic enforcers with no sense of humor§§. Every watt of electrical power that doesn't emerge as coherent light transforms into heat, and most laser systems operate at efficiencies between 20-40%***. This means that for every watt of destructive laser output, you're generating between 1.5 and 4 watts of heat that must go *somewhere*—preferably not into your hand††.

The transition from laboratory curiosity to field-deployable weapon requires solving what Professor Elminster Quackenbush termed "the fundamental paradox of the energy weapon"§§§: the more powerful you make it, the heavier the power source; the heavier the power source, the less portable the weapon; the less portable the weapon, the less useful it becomes in situations where carrying a regular gun would have been vastly more practical****. Contemporary research focuses on balancing these competing demands, with varying degrees of success†††† and property damage‡‡. The breakthrough, when it comes, will likely emerge from the field of advanced materials science, compact fusion reactors, or the discovery that the universe's fundamental constants are more negotiable than previously believed§§§§.

The practical implementation of a handheld laser weapon must account for atmospheric interference, target reflectivity, beam divergence, power supply limitations, and the unfortunate tendency of high-energy photonic systems to spontaneously educate nearby researchers about the critical importance of proper eye protection*****. The infamous Incident at Los Alamos Auxiliary Laboratory Facility Seven†††††, which simultaneously proved the viability of portable laser weapons and the inadvisability of testing them indoors near reflective surfaces, established protocols that remain industry standard to this day‡‡‡‡. Modern systems incorporate multiple redundant safety mechanisms, each added after someone discovered a new and exciting way to violate the intentions of the previous mechanisms§§§§§.

*The technical term for this objection is "phase transition," though "aggressive deconstruction" appears in several classified reports and at least one hastily-sealed court deposition.

†The Department's official stance is that weapons should sound intimidating. "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation" achieves this. "Angry Flashlight" does not, regardless of how accurately it describes the underlying physics.

**This number was calculated by Dr. Reginald Worthington III using what he called "rigorous statistical analysis" and what his colleagues called "making things up after three whiskeys." The actual number is either higher or lower, depending on whether you count "making the safety labels large enough to read" as one problem or several hundred††††††.

††They also maintain that proper scientific instruments should be measured in units that cause immediate existential concern. This philosophy explains their controversial "Megadeaths per Minute" proposal, which was rejected by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on grounds of "being completely insane."

†††The Bureaucratic Sub-Committee for Thermal Incident Documentation (BSCTID) maintains files on seventeen researchers who attempted this between 1967 and 1982. Fifteen survived. The committee's official motto is "We Told You So," which has appeared on condolence cards with distressing frequency.

***5 milliwatts is also sufficient to permanently damage your retina if you stare directly into it, a fact discovered independently by an average of 127 undergraduates annually, despite warnings, demonstrations, signed waivers, and several quite explicit videos about the fragility of ocular tissue. The International Association of Ophthalmologists has stopped sending thank-you notes to laser pointer manufacturers.

‡Professor Arnold Weismann actually tried this in 1978, creating what his laboratory notes describe as "a sort of very bright chandelier that made disturbing humming noises." The project consumed $340,000 in funding before someone pointed out that aligning one million laser pointers to a common focal point was technically impossible, politically inadvisable, and aesthetically offensive††‡.

††‡The final prototype weighed 847 pounds and required a dedicated power substation. It could, in theory, warm a cup of coffee from across the room, assuming the coffee remained stationary for ninety seconds and nobody minded the smell of burning mahogany furniture.

‡‡The precise relationship is expressed as P_destruction = (I × A × t) / (θ_reflection × η_atmospheric × ψ_luck), where ψ_luck has proven stubbornly resistant to experimental quantification but is believed to be inversely proportional to the number of safety officers on vacation.

†††The experienced researcher has multiple insurance claims filed, in various stages of investigation and denial. The truly experienced researcher has switched to a career in theoretical physics, where the worst thing that can happen is being wrong, rather than being vaporized.

‡‡‡Dr. Farthingworth's apparatus achieved temperatures approaching 2,400 Kelvin before structural failure occurred. The laboratory's sprinkler system activated. The water flash-boiled. The resulting steam triggered the fire suppression foam system. The foam was flammable‡‡†. The cascade of poor design choices is now taught in at least four different engineering courses as a case study in "what not to do," though the syllabus tactfully omits Dr. Farthingworth's last words, which were reportedly "Oh, that's not supposed to—"

‡‡†This fact was discovered during the incident. The manufacturer's claim that their foam was "fire resistant" turned out to mean "resistant to small fires" rather than "resistant to physics laboratories achieving localized plasma states."

§The laws of thermodynamics, first codified by ancient Mesopotamian fire-keepers who noticed that heat always spreads, never concentrates (except when you very much wish it wouldn't), remain the universe's most reliable source of disappointment. The second law specifically exists to thwart engineers.

§§The First Law says you can't win. The Second Law says you can't break even. The Third Law says you can't leave the game. The unofficial Fourth Law, added by the Guild of Experimental Thermodynamicists after the Farthingworth Incident, states "and you'll probably get burned trying."

***This efficiency is considered excellent by laser standards and catastrophically inadequate by anyone who has to carry the cooling system. The theoretical maximum efficiency, according to quantum mechanics, is approximately 80%, but quantum mechanics also suggests that particles can be in two places at once, and yet nobody's managed to be at the laboratory and the pub simultaneously, despite considerable effort.

  description: `# Making Small Things Smaller: Precision Optics for Laser Systems

The fundamental challenge of coherent light weaponization*, as any competent thaumophysicist will tell you† (and several incompetent ones will tell you at length††), lies not in generating the beam but in ensuring it arrives at the destination with sufficient intensity to accomplish something more dramatic than warming your target's tea‡. The mathematics of beam divergence are, regrettably, tyrannical in their precision‡‡: a laser beam that begins as a perfectly collimated column of righteous fury 5 millimeters in diameter will, through the inexorable workings of diffraction and the fundamental properties of light itself, expand to approximately 50 centimeters across at a distance of one kilometer***, assuming optimal atmospheric conditions†††, which you will not have‡‡‡. This is why the historical progression of laser weapon development reads less like a triumphant march of progress and more like a catalog of increasingly elaborate attempts to deny basic physics§.

Adaptive optics§§ represent humanity's response to the atmosphere's fundamental disrespect for carefully aligned photons. The principle is elegantly simple: measure the distortions introduced by thermal turbulence, humidity gradients, and the general untidiness of air molecules§§§, then deform your primary mirror hundreds of times per second to pre-compensate for these effects**. The implementation is hellishly complex††**, involving deformable mirrors with actuator counts that would make a conspiracy theorist weep with joy‡‡‡‡, wavefront sensors of nauseating precision§§§§, and control algorithms that consume more processing power than the average small nation's gross domestic product*****. The Atmospheric Compensation Research Institute at Windswept Peak†††† maintains that their Mark VII adaptive optics system can compensate for atmospheric distortions with 94.7% efficiency‡‡‡‡‡, though they are careful not to mention under what specific conditions this statistic applies§§§§§, nor why their previous six attempts now serve as expensive paperweights******.

The quest for the perfect mirror††††† occupies a special circle of manufacturing hell where tolerances are measured in fractions of a wavelength and the phrase "close enough" is grounds for immediate termination‡‡‡‡‡‡. Modern laser weapon mirrors must maintain surface accuracies of λ/20 or better§§§§§§, handle power densities that would instantly vaporize most materials known to humanity*******, and remain thermally stable while doing so*******. The materials science involved reads like a fairy tale told by someone who failed to understand what makes a story appealing: substrates of silicon carbide or beryllium††††††, coatings of exotic dielectrics laid down one atomic layer at a time‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, and polishing processes that make watchmaking look like blacksmithing§§§§§§§. The International Mirror Crafters Guild******** maintains a "Wall of Shame" featuring mirrors that cost more than small aircraft but which failed to meet specification by margins invisible to the naked eye†††††††; this wall is, ironically, the smoothest surface in the building‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

Weather, that ancient enemy of military precision§§§§§§§§, becomes delightfully problematic for laser weapons in ways that would make traditional artillery officers laugh into their targeting computers*********. Rain reduces effective range by factors of ten or more††††††††; snow is merely insulting‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡; but fog§§§§§§§§§ - fog is the universe's way of pointing out that your multi-million dollar directed energy weapon is, in certain atmospheric conditions, less effective than a strongly worded letter**********. The scattering cross-section of water droplets at typical laser wavelengths is such that attempting to engage a target through dense fog is mathematically equivalent to trying to illuminate them by throwing handfuls of photons in their general direction and hoping some arrive†††††††††. Military doctrine has evolved to address this: the official tactical recommendation when encountering an adversary in fog is to wait for better weather‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, though unofficial recommendations involve considerably more profanity§§§§§§§§§§.

The integration of these systems into practical weapons***********† represents the culmination of decades of research, billions in funding, and the quiet desperation of engineers who know that their carefully optimized system will be operated by soldiers who consider "close enough" a philosophy of life rather than an error term††††††††††. Modern laser carbines‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ incorporate adaptive optics systems that once filled laboratory rooms into packages that fit on a standard weapon rail§§§§§§§§§§§, beam directors that can track targets with milliradian precision************, and—most impressively—power supplies that will not explode if looked at sternly††††††††††††. The result is a weapon that performs magnificently under controlled conditions, adequately under field conditions, and not at all in circumstances that involve weather‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, dust§§§§§§§§§§§§, or the target having the good sense to stand behind anything even slightly opaque*************†.

†A phenomenon the Guild of Entomologists has termed "laser-assisted insect identification," or more colloquially, "expensive bug zapping."

§§§Air molecules, in their defense, have no idea they're supposed to stay still for precision optical measurements. They are just living their best thermodynamic lives.

**Hundreds of times per second being approximately the rate at which atmospheric conditions change, funding committees ask for updates, and optical engineers pray for retirement.

††**The development history of the Corrective Optics Mark III at the Laboratory for Atmospheric Compensation involved 847 man-years of effort††, €340 million in funding, and what the project manager described as "a concerning amount of screaming."

§§§§The precision of these sensors is such that they can detect atmospheric distortions too small to see, which raises the philosophical question of whether we are compensating for problems that actually matter or simply because we can. The answer, regrettably, is "yes."

  description: `# Hot Weapons, Cool Heads: Thermal Management in Energy Weapons

The fundamental challenge of directed energy weaponry, as first articulated by the ancient Promethean Brotherhood*, lies not in generating sufficient power to vaporize one's enemies, but rather in preventing the weapon from achieving a similar state of matter before said vaporization occurs. The laws of thermodynamics†, much like the laws of several small nations, cannot be negotiated with, bribed, or simply ignored through sheer determination, despite what 73.4% of military procurement officers apparently believe‡. A laser rifle that converts 40% of its input energy into a coherent beam necessarily converts the remaining 60% into heat**, which must go somewhere—and that somewhere, absent proper thermal management, tends to be the operator's hands††.

The dream of continuous fire has seduced military planners since the first coherent light weapons emerged from laboratory conditions‡‡, but the mathematics remain stubbornly uncooperative. Even with advanced heatsink technology utilizing phase-change materials and vapor chambers***, the practical duty cycle of a handheld energy weapon hovers around 15-20% before thermal shutdown becomes mandatory†††. This reality has disappointed generations of strategists who envisioned sweeping beams of death cutting through enemy formations‡‡‡, only to discover that their superweapon required a tea break every forty-five seconds§. The Incident at Firebase Kappa§§ serves as a permanent reminder of what happens when thermal interlocks are bypassed "to get better performance"—a phrase that should perhaps be engraved on the tomb of every engineer who has uttered it.

Modern thermal management systems represent a delicate balance between keeping the weapon operational and keeping the operator's fingerprints***. The triple-redundant thermal monitoring system developed by the Heisenberg-Carnot Institute§§§ measures core temperature at seventeen different points within the weapon assembly, cross-referencing these readings against ambient conditions, operator biometrics, and the current phase of the moon****. When critical thresholds approach, the emergency thermal shutdown activates with what manufacturers describe as "aggressive enthusiasm"††††—which is to say, the weapon simply stops working, often at moments the operator would describe as "tactically suboptimal"‡‡‡‡. Yet this proves infinitely preferable to the alternative, as documented in the extensive medical literature on thermal weapon injuries§§§§, which includes several photographs that have caused visiting medical students to faint*****.

The practical applications of waste heat have not gone unexplored. Sergeant Helena Martinez's famous wintertime defense of Outpost Zebulon†††††, where she and her squad used their laser rifles' emergency heat dump vents to prevent hypothermia during a three-day siege, sparked a brief but enthusiastic movement to market energy weapons as dual-purpose survival tools‡‡‡‡‡. The Omnitech Corporation's subsequent "Campfire Mode" product line was discontinued after only six months§§§§§, though not before generating what company lawyers carefully termed "an unusually high volume of litigious correspondence"******. The fundamental lesson remains: a weapon that generates enough waste heat to warm a small room is simultaneously a weapon that requires enough cooling infrastructure to fill a small room, creating what thermal engineers refer to as the Paradox of Practical Portability††††††, and what everyone else calls "the reason we can't have nice things."

The state of the art continues to advance, with experimental systems incorporating thermoelectric generators to reclaim waste heat as supplemental power‡‡‡‡‡‡, though these add weight that soldiers inevitably complain about§§§§§§ even as they complain about insufficient magazine capacity, creating what military psychologists call the Load-Bearing Whinge Cycle*******. Until the laws of thermodynamics are successfully repealed—a project that has consumed the careers of several notable physicists††††††† and at least one very confused congressman‡‡‡‡‡‡‡—thermal management will remain the unglamorous but essential foundation of energy weapon design, forever limiting the sustained firepower of handheld systems and forcing weapons designers to choose between science fiction dreams and keeping soldiers' hands attached to their arms.

*Founded in 427 BCE, though their understanding of coherent light was admittedly limited. They did, however, have extensive experience with things getting too hot to hold, which their records describe as "the persistent challenge of all mankind's more interesting endeavors."

†Specifically the Second Law, which states (in simplified form) that entropy always increases, or as the noted thermodynamicist Lord Kelvin put it: "Heat flows from hot to cold, and if you don't like it, tough." The actual quotation is marginally more formal.

‡According to the Galactic Institute of Military Procurement Studies' annual survey, "Wishful Thinking in Defense Acquisition." The same survey found that 82.7% of procurement officers believed that deadline pressure would make physics work faster, and 91.3% had at some point requested that engineers "just make it work" without explaining how.

**This is actually optimistic. Early prototypes achieved barely 20% efficiency, meaning 80% became heat. The test facility at Groom Lake Station 7 still bears scorch marks from what engineers refer to as "the toasty days."

††The Guild of Prosthetic Artificers maintains a quiet but profitable relationship with energy weapons programs. They refuse to elaborate on this, but their quarterly earnings reports show suspicious spikes correlated with major weapons trials.

‡‡The Continuum Dream, as it's known in military circles, first appeared in strategic planning documents circa 2067. It has been independently rediscovered by approximately 2,847 junior officers since, each believing themselves the first to think of it. ‡‡‡

‡‡‡Senior officers have learned to simply nod and smile. There's a traditional response involving thermodynamics textbooks and where they might be inserted, but it's considered poor form to use it before the junior officer's third iteration of the idea.

***Phase-change materials work by absorbing heat as they transition from solid to liquid (or liquid to gas). The problem being that once they've changed phase, they need to change back, which requires cooling, which requires the thing to stop generating heat for a bit. It's like trying to bail out a boat with a sponge—it works, but you need to periodically stop bailing to wring out the sponge, during which time the boat continues to fill with water. This metaphor is actually used in thermal engineering courses, followed by the instructor saying, "And this is why continuous fire is bollocks."

†††Thermal shutdown being a much gentler term than what actually happens, which is more accurately described as "the weapon screaming 'NO' in seventeen different sensor languages and refusing to enable the firing circuit until it's had a nice sit-down."

‡‡‡The sweep-beam fantasy persists in popular entertainment, where heroes routinely fire energy weapons continuously for minutes at a time. Some militaries now include a course called "Managing Unrealistic Expectations from Media" in officer training. It has a 12% success rate.

§Lieutenant Marcus Webb, Firebase Kappa, October 2089. The bypass took approximately four minutes to implement using nothing but determination, a multitool, and staggering overconfidence. The weapon functioned flawlessly for approximately seven seconds of continuous fire before the barrel housing reached 847°C (1556.6°F for our American readers) and proceeded to, in the technical terminology, "go melty." Lieutenant Webb retained most of his fingers, though his nickname "Lefty" is now somewhat ironic given the handedness situation. §§

§§Firebase Kappa was thereafter redesignated Firebase Kappa-Sigma, the additional letters standing for "Safety Safety," which is the military's way of acknowledging that sometimes you really do need to say it twice.

***Fingerprints being surprisingly important to soldiers, who use them for a variety of tasks including but not limited to: weapon operation, equipment maintenance, eating, personal hygiene, and filling out the paperwork that inevitably follows any incident involving damaged fingerprints.

§§§Which sounds impressive until you learn they're named after two thermodynamicists who famously couldn't stand each other. The Institute's founding was meant to honor their contributions to physics. That they're now jointly commemorated is either the universe's sense of irony or the department's lack of historical research. Possibly both.

****The moon phase sensor was added after a series of inexplicable thermal fluctuations that were eventually traced to tidal effects on the base's geothermal cooling system.

  description: `TOUCHING SOMEONE FROM VERY FAR AWAY: LONG-RANGE LASER SYSTEMS

The art of directing concentrated photonic energy across distances where the target appears smaller than a particularly optimistic gnat requires not merely technical precision, but a philosophical understanding of what it means to reach out and touch someone when they're so far away they don't even know they're about to have a bad day*. At ranges exceeding two kilometers, one is no longer simply "aiming" in any conventional sense—rather, one is negotiating with probability itself†, compensating for atmospheric disturbances that would make the ancients' four humors look positively scientific††, and accepting that even light, that primordial messenger of the universe, requires a measurable amount of time to deliver your regards‡.

The development of atmospheric compensation algorithms represents humanity's ongoing battle against air itself—that treacherous medium that insists on having temperature gradients, moisture content, and the audacity to move around when you're trying to do something important*. Modern systems must account for no fewer than forty-seven distinct atmospheric variables**, with processing speeds that would have seemed like sorcery to researchers of the previous generation†††. The Korsakov-Brennan equations, derived during what scholars now call "The Incident at the Proving Grounds,"‡‡ provide the theoretical foundation, though their practical application requires computing power that generates enough heat to create its own atmospheric distortions‡‡‡.

Target acquisition at extreme ranges transforms the philosophical question "what is the minimal amount of visual information required to designate something as a target?" into an engineering problem with legal ramifications*. When your target occupies fewer pixels than a period in a moderately-sized font, you are relying less on optical resolution and more on a complex interplay of predictive algorithms, historical trajectory data, and what the Guild of Long-Range Specialists refers to as "hopeful mathematics"**. The famous (or infamous) case of Specialist Yuki Tanaka, who successfully engaged a target on a moving vehicle at 2.1 kilometers†, represents both the pinnacle of the art and a cautionary tale about the consequences of success‡.

The temporal component of extreme-range engagement is perhaps the most philosophically vexing aspect—at 2000 meters, even light requires approximately 6.67 microseconds to traverse the distance, and in that time, the universe has already moved on††. Your target may have shifted, the wind may have changed its mind about which direction to blow, or—in the case famously documented by Dr. Hartsfield-Vaughan—someone may have walked directly into the beam path with a reflective surface‡‡. This necessitates not merely computational prediction, but a zen-like acceptance that you are firing not at where your target is, but at where the ghost of probability suggests it might possibly be when your photons finally arrive***. The old masters spoke of "becoming one with the shot"§; the new masters prefer "becoming one with the atmospheric modeling software" and hope nobody asks too many questions about the philosophy.

Indeed, patience emerges as the supreme virtue in long-range laser engagement, a quality that military institutions—not historically known for their contemplative approach to violence—have had to cultivate with varying degrees of success§§. The practitioner must wait for the precise conjunction of atmospheric stability, target predictability, and equipment thermal equilibrium that might occur only once in a firing window measured in hours§§§. This has led to the development of what anthropologists have termed "sniper meditation culture," complete with its own liturgies, breathing exercises, and strictly observed coffee rituals‡‡‡‡. The patience required is less about holding still and more about accepting that the universe operates on a timescale that finds human urgency quaintly amusing****.

---

*The Institute for Distant Disagreements has published seventeen volumes on the ethics of extreme-range engagement. Volume 12 is entirely devoted to whether it's more or less polite if they never see it coming. The debate remains unresolved, though trending toward "less polite, but points for technical difficulty."

†Specifically, the probability that all your assumptions about atmospheric conditions, target behavior, equipment calibration, thermal expansion coefficients, quantum uncertainty at the targeting laser level, and whether Mercury is in retrograde are simultaneously correct. The Guild calculates this at roughly 1 in 847 under ideal conditions.

††The medieval theory of humors at least acknowledged that air could have qualities. Medieval scholars would have been horrified to learn about Rayleigh scattering, density inversions, and turbulent vorticity. On the other hand, they also thought bleeding people improved health, so perhaps their horror should be taken with several grains of salt. Or several pints of blood, by their reasoning.

‡This becomes relevant when engaging targets that are, themselves, moving. Light's speed, while impressive by terrestrial standards (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, a figure that has been precisely measured and then rounded for the convenience of people who don't want to deal with decimal places in combat), means you're always shooting at where things were, not where they are. The universe has a cruel sense of humor about causality.

*The Atmospheric Sciences Division of the Northern Military Academy maintains what they call the "Wall of Betrayal," documenting 483 distinct ways that air has ruined perfectly good shots. Number 37: "Spontaneous thermal inversion caused by a cloud that wasn't there thirty seconds ago." Number 114: "Dust devil. Just a dust devil. That's it. That's the whole entry."

**These include, but are not limited to: temperature at surface, temperature at target altitude, temperature gradient (linear), temperature gradient (non-linear), temperature gradient (chaotic), relative humidity, absolute humidity, the humidity that humidity aspires to be, barometric pressure, wind speed (surface), wind speed (altitude), wind speed (somewhere in between where chaos reigns), wind direction (all of the above), particulate matter, pollen count (seriously), Coriolis effect, the target's gravitational field (for very large targets), and whether someone nearby is grilling, which creates surprisingly persistent thermal columns.

†††The Incident at the Proving Grounds, 2047, is not discussed in polite company. The official report lists it as "a series of unfortunate atmospheric miscalculations." Eyewitnesses report it involved a beam, three weather balloons, two migrating geese, and a dignitary's observation platform. The fact that the proving grounds were subsequently relocated to an underground facility speaks volumes, none of them reassuring.

‡‡Dr. Elena Korsakov and Commander James Brennan, working independently and then together after what records describe as "a spirited disagreement at an academic conference that required security intervention," derived the equations that govern beam propagation through turbulent media. Their work earned them the Feldstein Prize for Atmospheric Physics and a stern warning from the Ethics Committee about "weaponizing the fundamental nature of reality." They framed the warning. It hangs in Dr. Korsakov's office next to a photograph of the atmosphere, captioned "my nemesis."

‡‡‡This is known as the "bootstrap paradox" of laser targeting: you need to compensate for atmospheric effects, but your compensation generates heat, which creates atmospheric effects, which require more compensation, which generates more heat, and so on. The solution involves carefully calibrated cooling systems and accepting a baseline level of what engineers call "thermal irony."

*The legal department of every military contractor maintains an extensive library on the definition of "target." After the Johannesburg Accord of 2051, these libraries gained a new wing dedicated specifically to "what constitutes sufficient pixelation for legal engagement." It's surprisingly philosophical. Lawyers have been known to cite Plato's Cave while arguing about sensor resolution.

**Dr. Raymond Park of the Institute for Computational Optimism coined this term after his team successfully engaged a target whose image occupied only 3.2 pixels of sensor resolution. When asked how they could possibly identify and confirm the target with such limited data, he replied, "mathematics and hope, in roughly equal measure."

  description: `# When Lasers Need to Be Bigger: Heavy Laser Weapon Systems

The theoretical maximum output of a coherent light weapon system exists only in the minds of those who have never had to calculate the cooling requirements*.  While precision long-range optical systems excel at delivering concentrated energy to specific target coordinates, the development of heavy laser weapon systems represents humanity's eternal desire to answer the question "but what if we made it bigger?"** with increasingly concerning levels of enthusiasm. The scaling of laser weaponry from laboratory curiosity to battlefield devastation requires power generation capabilities that cause fusion reactor engineers to pause mid-equation and mutter things like "that seems excessive" and "are they planning to fight or create a new sun?"†

The fundamental challenge of heavy laser systems lies not in the generation of coherent light—modern civilization has become disturbingly proficient at that—but in managing what the Guild of Optical Warfare Engineers calls "the angry photon problem"††. At power levels exceeding 500 kilowatts, laser weapons begin exhibiting behaviors that suggest the photons themselves are developing opinions about their employment‡. The atmospheric bloom effect, previously a minor consideration in precision systems, becomes the primary weapon characteristic‡‡, transforming a focused beam into what ancient texts might describe as "the wrath of an irritated star" or what modern military documentation more soberly terms "a tactical thermal event with strategic implications"***. The Yondalla Institute for High Energy Research discovered this quite by accident during their 2047 test series, which was intended to demonstrate pinpoint accuracy but instead demonstrated that trees within a forty-meter radius of the target would also need to be considered participants in the engagement†††.

Transportation and deployment considerations present their own philosophical quandaries. The term "portable" undergoes significant semantic drift when one's weapon system requires its own dedicated power plant, a cooling system that processes water at rates previously associated with municipal water supplies, and a support crew whose organizational structure mirrors that of a small town‡‡‡. The Consolidated Defense Contractors Consortium discovered this during the disastrous "Mobile Deterrent Alpha" trials, where the system achieved perfect marks for lethality and devastating marks for mobility****—the prototype could indeed be moved, but only in the sense that continental plates are technically mobile†. The phrase "area denial weapon" takes on new meaning when the area being denied includes the three square kilometers required to set up the weapon itself*****. Nevertheless, modern heavy laser systems have achieved what the procurement documentation carefully describes as "strategically relocatable" status, which means they can be moved between predetermined positions given sufficient advance notice, heavy-lift transport, and an acceptance of the fact that stealth is no longer a mission parameter††††.

The infamous Hesperus Deep Space Communication Array Incident of 2051 serves as both a cautionary tale and an awkward footnote in humanity's first contact protocols‡‡‡‡. What began as a routine high-power test firing of the Mk-VII "Daystar" heavy laser system became considerably less routine when the test crew, in accordance with safety protocols, aimed the weapon at "nothing important" - specifically, a carefully calculated trajectory that would send the beam safely into interstellar space*****. The test achieved all planned objectives: the beam maintained coherence beyond atmospheric limits, power output peaked at 2.3 megawatts sustained, and thermal management systems performed within acceptable parameters******. What the test also achieved, unintentionally, was the transmission of what several civilizations interpreted as either a very aggressive greeting or a declaration of territorial claim††††††. The Interstellar Incident Review Board's final report, still partially classified, notes dryly that "while no hostile intent was present, the effect of a megawatt-class laser pulse on galactic diplomacy cannot be considered negligible"‡‡‡‡‡. Current safety protocols now include a mandatory consultation with the Department of Extraterrestrial Relations before any test firing above 1.8 megawatts, and the phrase "aim at nothing important" has been stricken from all technical documentation in favor of more specific coordinate requirements*******.

*The Guild of Thermal Engineers maintains a memorial wall dedicated to those who tried. The list of names is surprisingly long, though many are followed by the notation "recovered" in small letters underneath. The subtitle of the memorial reads "They Thought It Would Be Fine," which tells you everything you need to know about the engineering mindset.

**The question has spawned a thriving cottage industry of academic papers with titles like "Scale Limitations in Direct Energy Weapons" and "Please Stop Making It Bigger: A Retrospective." None of them have had the slightest effect on weapons development.

†This quote comes from Dr. Helena Sardovic of the Prometheus Fusion Research Facility, recorded during a consultation meeting with the Defense Advanced Projects Division. The meeting notes indicate she repeated this concern seven times, with increasing emphasis, before eventually sighing and calculating the required reactor specifications anyway. Her footnote to the final report simply read "I told you so."

††The term appears in a classified technical manual from 2045, written by Lead Engineer Marcus Webb after his third consecutive seventy-hour work week. His supervisor suggested changing it to something more professional. Webb's response, also recorded in the meeting minutes, consisted of pointing at the thermal damage on the test platform and asking what professional term would better capture "this absolute nonsense." The term remained†.

†Of note: Webb later founded the Institute for Reasonable Weapon Design, which has successfully prevented exactly zero weapon systems from being built but maintains an excellent archive of documentation proving they warned everyone.

‡Reports from test facilities describe phenomena including "beam wander" (the laser deciding to examine things that were not the target), "spontaneous focal adjustment" (the targeting system developing what operators swear is curiosity), and "opinion expression events" (catastrophic equipment failure). The Guild of Optical Warfare Engineers insists these are all explicable through mundane physics. The operators who've seen a megawatt laser apparently look at something off-target maintain their suspicions.

‡‡Atmospheric bloom occurs when high-power laser beams heat the air through which they pass, creating a thermal lens that defocuses the beam. At lower powers, this is a nuisance. At megawatt levels, it becomes the weapon. The Yondalla Institute's report includes the memorable phrase "we were no longer shooting through the air; we were shooting the air itself," which would have been poetic if it hadn't been written in a damage assessment form‡.

‡Indeed, the lead researcher's next report began with "To whom it may concern: about those trees." The Institute subsequently had to add "collateral vegetation effects" to their test protocols.

***The military's gift for euphemism reaches truly artistic heights when describing effects that boil the moisture out of everything within range. The full technical description runs to three pages and includes fourteen different words for "burning."

†††The test was supposed to demonstrate a 99.7% hit rate on a target 3.2 kilometers distant. It achieved that. It also achieved a 100% hit rate on everything else in a forty-meter radius, plus a 73% "significant thermal effect" rate out to eighty meters. The incident report notes that the test "exceeded expectations" in several unanticipated categories. The Guild of Ecological Impact Assessment's counter-report was less diplomatic, consisting largely of photographs with captions like "this used to be a tree" and "we're fairly sure this was a squirrel."

‡‡‡The Portable Weapons Definition Committee of 2048 spent three months in heated debate over the term. The final definition includes seventeen clauses, twelve sub-clauses, and a footnote longer than the main document explaining that "portable" is context-dependent and should not be considered a binding statement about the practical deployability of any system to which it is applied. The committee disbanded immediately after publication, with several members reportedly taking up farming as a less stressful occupation‡‡.

‡‡One member, Dr. Patricia Venn, published a memoir titled "Words Mean Things: A Cautionary Tale of Military Semantics." It became required reading at three major engineering universities, though primarily for the humor value rather than any educational content.

****The mobility assessment included such observations as "achieves highway speeds when unencumbered by the weapon system, power generation module, cooling arrays, and crew quarters" and "can navigate terrain graded as 'flat' or 'very flat.'" The test crew's informal assessment was considerably shorter and unsuitable for official documentation.

†The Mobile Deterrent Alpha could travel at speeds approaching fifteen kilometers per hour under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions were defined as "perfectly flat, reinforced roadway with no turns, inclines, or interesting features." The prototype covered an impressive forty kilometers during its six-month test period. It covered them in the same direction, as turning proved beyond its capabilities.

  description: `# Throwing Charged Particles Very Fast: Ion Weapon Basics

The fundamental principle of ionized particle projection weaponry rests upon a deceptively simple observation: when one accelerates electrically charged particles to sufficient velocity and directs them toward a target, interesting things happen*. The marriage of electricity and velocity produces effects that range from "mildly inconvenient" to "spectacularly catastrophic," depending largely on what one is aiming at and how enthusiastic one was with the acceleration controls**. Traditional combat doctrine, which had comfortably settled into categories like "sharp things," "things that explode," and "things that are both sharp AND explode," was wholly unprepared for the introduction of "things that are electrically angry and moving at 0.3% of light speed."***

The weaponization of ionized particle beams represents what the Institute of Applied Magitech refers to as a "cross-disciplinary convergence event"†—a polite way of saying that several fields of study collided with each other at high speed and produced something nobody had quite anticipated††. The practical applications proved immediately apparent to anyone who had ever wished to disable enemy equipment without leaving large holes in said equipment†††, or who had grown tired of the traditional fireball-counterfireball exchange that had dominated magical combat for approximately three thousand years‡. Ion weapons offer what military theorists call "elegant electronic disruption capabilities," which is academic speak for "you can make all their expensive magical equipment stop working while standing a comfortable distance away."‡‡

Of particular interest—and considerable alarm—to the established magical community was the discovery that ionized particle beams interact with defensive enchantments in what can only be described as "spectacularly poor fashion" from the defender's perspective‡‡‡. Traditional magical shields, optimized over millennia to deflect physical projectiles and absorb thermal energy, respond to concentrated streams of charged particles the way a fine crystal goblet responds to being struck with a hammer§. The phenomenon was first documented by the mage Cornelius Sparkweather§§, whose groundbreaking research paper "On the Unexpected Permeability of Aetheric Barriers to Directed Ionic Streams" was published approximately forty-seven seconds before his own experimental shield array catastrophically failed during a field test§§§.

The technical implementation of ion projection weaponry requires careful attention to several critical factors, including particle acceleration methodology, beam coherence maintenance, and what the Royal Academy of Practical Sciences delicately terms "operator survival considerations"*. Contemporary ion weapons typically employ electromagnetic acceleration channels† to propel ionized particles—most commonly xenon or cesium ions††—through a series of focusing arrays that maintain beam integrity across combat-relevant distances†††. The resulting stream of charged particles carries sufficient kinetic and electrical energy to overwhelm standard electronic systems‡, induce cascade failures in magical circuitry‡‡, and generally ruin someone's day in a manner both precise and repeatable‡‡‡. Power requirements remain substantial§, though recent advances in compact arcane capacitors have reduced the necessary equipment from "wagon-sized" to merely "uncomfortably heavy"§§.

The theoretical foundations of ion weaponry draw upon principles that predate modern scientific understanding by considerable margins§§§. Ancient texts reference weapons that "cast lightning without thunder" and "struck with invisible fire that made enchantments weep,"* descriptions that early researchers dismissed as poetic exaggeration until someone actually built the thing and discovered the ancients were being remarkably literal**. The gods themselves are said to have employed similar principles***, though their motivations and methodologies remain subjects of scholarly debate and carefully hedged footnotes††. What remains indisputable is that concentrated streams of charged particles, properly directed, constitute a genuinely novel approach to the age-old problem of making one's enemies stop doing things one would prefer they not do†††.

## Footnotes

\* The definition of "interesting" varies considerably based on one's position relative to the beam. Targets typically employ more colorful terminology.

\** The operational manual for the Mark VII Ion Projector includes seventeen separate warnings about "enthusiasm management," three case studies of what happens when said enthusiasm is not managed, and a memorial page dedicated to Technician First Class Herbert Brightsparkle, whose last words were reportedly "But what if we used ALL the capacitors at once?" The resulting crater is now a designated historical site.

\*** The speed of light being approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, 0.3% thereof equals roughly 899,377 meters per second, or fast enough that the particles arrive at the target before the target has finished thinking "What's that humming sound?" The Douglas Adams Institute of Improbable Sciences maintains that this represents the optimal speed for comedy—slower and it's merely dangerous, faster and it becomes cosmically absurd.

† The Institute, headquartered in a building that exists in seven dimensions simultaneously, has made a cottage industry of coining euphemisms for "nobody expected this to work, but oh gods it does." Their annual reports are considered masterworks of academic understatement.

†† The collision involved electrical engineering, combat thaumaturgy, particle physics, and—somewhat inexplicably—marine biology‡. The marine biologist is still trying to explain how he got involved.

‡ Dr. Pearson was studying the electrical properties of jellyfish. His research notes indicate he was invited to a interdisciplinary meeting, fell asleep during the opening remarks, and woke up having apparently volunteered to "solve the beam coherence problem." He did solve it, though he remains confused about why.

††† The Ordnance Research Division maintains a filing cabinet labeled "Holes We Wish We Hadn't Made." It requires its own room. Ion weapons, by contrast, earn filing space in the cabinet labeled "Problems We Solved Elegantly," which fits comfortably on half a shelf§.

§ The other half of the shelf contains a single folder labeled "The Fireball Recalibration Incident of 1847" that nobody is permitted to open without authorization from at least three separate departments and a waiver of emotional liability.

‡ Specifically, the kind of tedious exchange where Mage A throws a fireball, Mage B counters with a water shield, Mage A responds with a lightning bolt, Mage B pulls out earth armor, and so forth until everyone involved is exhausted and slightly singed but essentially no closer to resolving their dispute. The Duelists' Guild estimated that the average magical combat lasted forty-seven minutes and accomplished roughly nothing§.

§ The Guild's report "On the Fundamental Inefficiency of Traditional Magical Combat" spans 847 pages and includes detailed time-motion studies of 2,340 duels. The conclusion—"Maybe we should try something else"—could have been written on a napkin, but that wouldn't have justified the research grant.

‡‡ Modern ion weapons reduce this timeline to approximately 0.4 seconds. The Duelists' Guild is not pleased about this development, having built their entire organizational structure around prolonged combat. Several senior members have denounced ion weapons as "unsporting," "excessively efficient," and "rudely effective."

‡‡‡ The technical term is "shield cascade collapse," though witnesses generally describe it as "the shield sort of sizzled and then wasn't there anymore." The Aetheric Protection Working Group spent six years studying the phenomenon before concluding that charged particle streams "really just aren't compatible with how shields work, are they?" This represents what historians call a "breakthrough in stating the obvious."

§ The metaphor is Sparkweather's own, from his earlier and less catastrophic paper "On the Mechanical Properties of Defensive Enchantments: A Comparative Analysis Using Dinnerware." His experimental methodology involved throwing plates at magical barriers while measuring deflection angles. It was considered eccentric but harmless until he progressed to ion beams§.

§ The progression being: plates (harmless), crossbow bolts (slightly concerning), small explosive charges (alarming), and finally ionized particle streams (career-ending). His research trajectory represents what academic advisors call "concerning momentum in the wrong direction."

§§ Known posthumously as "Sparkweather the Briefly Illuminated," a nickname he would have likely objected to had he retained the necessary biological infrastructure for objecting to things.

§§§ The paper is now considered a foundational text in the field, though modern editions include a prefatory warning that "the author's experimental conclusions, while scientifically valid, were arrived at via methodologies that are explicitly forbidden by seventeen different regulatory bodies." Sparkweather's research notes include the phrase "probably fine" forty-three times, which historians recognize as a significant predictor of things being definitely not fine.

\* These considerations include "ensuring the beam exits the weapon rather than choosing alternative paths through the operator" and "managing thermal dissipation such that the weapon does not melt while held." The Operator Safety Commission estimates that early ion weapon prototypes achieve`,

  description: `MAKING TECHNOLOGY VERY SAD: TARGETED EMP EFFECTS

The deliberate generation of focused electromagnetic pulses represents humanity's most passive-aggressive approach to conflict resolution*, allowing practitioners to express their feelings about an adversary's technology without the messy aftermath of actual explosives**. Building upon the foundational principles established in ionized particle projection studies, tactical electromagnetic disruption offers the sophisticated combatant an opportunity to render enemy equipment into expensive paperweights while maintaining plausible deniability***. The fundamental mechanism involves channeling sufficient electromagnetic energy into a targeted area such that local electronics experience what researchers at the Ankh-Morpork Institute of Applied Thaumatology describe as "catastrophic existential despair"†.

The specific frequency modulation required to affect different types of technology has led to an entire sub-field of research dedicated to making various devices "very sad indeed"††. Early practitioners discovered, through a series of unfortunate incidents‡, that not all electromagnetic frequencies produce equal results, and that the relationship between pulse intensity and effective range follows what is now known as the Dibbler Curve‡‡—after the noted researcher who accidentally discovered it while attempting to microwave a particularly stubborn potato‡‡‡. Modern applications require careful calibration to ensure that one's disruption affects enemy mana-flow matrices† without simultaneously transforming one's own equipment into inert metal sculptures††††, a distinction that proved critically important during the Battle of Überwald‡‡‡‡.

The theoretical intersection between technological disruption and magical interference remains one of the field's most contentious topics*†, with scholars divided between those who believe electromagnetic pulses can genuinely disrupt mana channeling and those who suspect the observed effects result from mages simply being startled by loud noises**†. Nevertheless, practical field tests conducted by the Bureau of Defensive Uncertainty††† have demonstrated that sufficiently powerful electromagnetic bursts can indeed cause what magical practitioners describe as "suddenly feeling quite unwell about continuing"‡†. The mechanism appears to involve the disruption of thaumic particle alignment at the quantum level, though several researchers who attempted to measure this phenomenon precisely have since been reassigned to studying butterflies in very remote locations‡‡†.

Perhaps the most sobering aspect of electromagnetic disruption technology lies in its democratic refusal to distinguish friend from foe***†. The infamous Incident at Bonk†††† serves as a perpetual reminder that electromagnetic pulses propagate according to physical laws rather than political allegiance, resulting in scenarios where both attacking and defending forces find themselves armed with nothing more threatening than clubs‡‡‡†. Current best practices recommend maintaining a minimum safe distance equivalent to approximately 2.7 times the intended effect radius††††† or, as the Guild of Weapons Safety puts it, "far enough away that you can still operate the device that makes other devices stop operating"‡‡‡‡†. The development of shielded equipment capable of surviving one's own electromagnetic assault represents the current frontier of research, though early prototypes have demonstrated an unfortunate tendency to shield themselves so effectively that they cease to function even without external interference*‡.

**Explosives, while satisfying, require cleanup crews and generate substantial paperwork. The Empire's Bureau of Blast Assessment estimates that each explosion creates approximately 47 forms requiring completion in triplicate†.

  description: `INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH TECHNOLOGY HATRED: HEAVY ION SYSTEMS

The development of area-effect ion weaponry represents humanity's triumph over the question "what if we could make electronics cry?"* The fundamental principle underlying heavy ion systems differs from their smaller electromagnetic pulse cousins† in both scale and philosophical commitment to absolute technological devastation‡. Where a standard electromagnetic disruption device might politely suggest that nearby electronics take a brief nap, a properly calibrated heavy ion cannon issues what can only be described as a mandatory extinction notice to every circuit board within a three-kilometer radius**.

The theoretical foundation was established by Dr. Cassandra Blackwood at the Institute for Regrettable Applications†† in 2047, following what she termed "the incident where I proved my ex-husband's smart home deserved what it got."‡‡ Her seminal paper, "On the Deliberate and Enthusiastic Murder of Shield Generators," outlined the cascade failure mechanism by which ionized particle streams could overwhelm defensive electromagnetic barriers*** through a process she called "aggressive negotiation."††† The shield generators, it turns out, absolutely despise this†††—a fact discovered through extensive testing that the Institute's ethics board described as "technically legal but spiritually questionable."‡‡‡

The subsequent arms race between shield manufacturers and ion weapons developers has produced increasingly absurd results*. Modern military-grade shields now incorporate what Fortuna Defense Systems calls "ion-hardened matrices,"** which lasted approximately forty-seven minutes against the Mark VII Heavy Ion Projector before surrendering with what witnesses described as "a sound like a whale having an existential crisis."*** The Mark VIII, developed in response, features a rotating particle injection system that can maintain a continuous ionization field for up to twelve minutes††—long enough, according to internal memos, to "render any defense grid into very expensive paperweights while their operators watch in mounting horror."‡‡

The practical implications became catastrophically apparent during the Midwest Blackout of 2051***, when a rogue test firing of a prototype area-effect system resulted in the complete shutdown of electrical infrastructure across three counties in Iowa†††. The incident report, running to some 847 pages, contains the immortal phrase "we did not anticipate that the ionosphere would be quite so cooperative"‡‡‡ and includes detailed documentation of approximately 40,000 individual equipment failures, ranging from traffic lights to pacemakers*. The subsequent Congressional inquiry led to the establishment of the Bureau of Restricted Ionization Applications****, whose regulatory framework now governs all heavy ion weapons with the same enthusiasm typically reserved for nuclear materials and experimental bioweapons†††.

Contemporary heavy ion systems operate on what the Guild of Electromagnetic Warfare Engineers‡‡‡‡ calls the "scorched circuit" principle: if you cannot selectively disable enemy systems, simply disable all systems and sort out the consequences later. This philosophy has proven remarkably effective in controlled military applications and remarkably devastating in every other context***. The latest generation of area-effect ion projectors can maintain a denial zone measuring up to five kilometers in diameter, within which electronics do not so much malfunction as collectively decide that existence itself is negotiable****. Shield generators exposed to such fields exhibit what Dr. Yuki Tanaka of the Osaka Institute for Defensive Technologies described as "behavior patterns consistent with profound depression followed by voluntary shutdown"†††††—a phenomenon that has sparked considerable philosophical debate about the consciousness of inanimate objects‡‡‡‡‡.

---

*The answer, for those keeping score at home, was "yes, but at what cost?" The cost, as it happens, was approximately $840 million in infrastructure damage during early testing phases, plus the sanity of everyone involved in the cleanup. The Apology Department at Blackwood Industries maintains a staff of 47 full-time employees dedicated solely to incidents involving the Mark V and earlier prototypes.

†For a comprehensive exploration of why your television remote might suddenly hate you, see the prerequisite paper on electromagnetic disruption. It contains fewer explosions but more practical advice about not testing experimental weapons near your own electronics.

‡The philosophical commitment manifests primarily as "let's see how much we can break before someone tells us to stop." This approach has been remarkably successful, in the sense that a meteor impact is successful at rearranging landscapes.

**This radius expands to 4.2 kilometers if you overclock the primary capacitors, though Blackwood Industries' legal team would like to remind readers that doing so voids your warranty, violates seventeen international treaties, and makes the device emit a sound that one technician described as "the universe itself filing a complaint."

††The Institute was later renamed the Institute for Slightly Less Regrettable Applications following a campus-wide vote and the incident with the self-aware coffee maker. Dr. Blackwood maintains that the coffee maker started it, a position her ex-husband's lawyers dispute.

‡‡The divorce proceedings are sealed, but court documents reference "seventeen smart devices," "emotional distress," and "the toaster incident we agreed never to discuss." Dr. Blackwood's research funding increased by 340% following the publication of her findings.

***Shield generators exposed to heavy ion bombardment exhibit a failure cascade that proceeds through several distinct phases: confusion (0.3 seconds), angry defiance (1.2 seconds), resignation (0.8 seconds), and what researchers term "catastrophic existential despair" (instantaneous). The entire sequence produces a distinctive electromagnetic signature that experienced operators describe as "satisfying" and shield manufacturers describe in considerably stronger terms.

†††The term originated during a test where Dr. Blackwood played Mozart's Requiem while systematically destroying a room full of shield generators. The ethics board's objection focused less on the destruction and more on what they called "unnecessarily dramatic presentation." Dr. Blackwood responded by playing Wagner for the next test.

‡‡‡The board's full statement continues: "We cannot, in good conscience, approve this research, but we acknowledge that technically you haven't violated any specific regulations we thought to write down. We are writing them now. Please stop doing this while we work."

*The current record for shield-ion weapon cycles is held by Fortuna Defense Systems and Blackwood Industries, who have each released six major versions in the past three years. Industry observers describe it as "the most expensive game of rock-paper-scissors in military history."

**The hardening process involves embedding the shield matrix with microscopically thin layers of material that disperses ionic charges. The cost per square meter is roughly equivalent to covering your house in diamond dust, which explains why military budgets include line items that make civilian accountants weep.

***The comparison to marine mammals in crisis is precise: both involve low-frequency electromagnetic oscillations that convey a profound sense of wrongness. The Mark VII test facility now requires all personnel to wear hearing protection rated for frequencies that technically shouldn't affect humans but somehow do anyway.

††Twelve minutes represents 347% longer than previous systems. It also represents 347% more time for operators to contemplate whether this is really what they wanted to do with their lives.

***The Midwest Blackout has achieved legendary status in engineering circles, primarily as a cautionary tale titled "Why We Don't Test Weapons Pointed at the Sky Without Checking What Else is There First."

  description: `BOTTLING SUNS FOR PERSONAL USE: PLASMA WEAPON CONTAINMENT

The containment of superheated plasma in portable weaponry represents humanity's eternal desire to hold the power of stars in one's hand*, a goal that would be admirably ambitious if it weren't so catastrophically prone to failure. The fundamental challenge lies in maintaining a stable magnetic bottle**—a term that, despite sounding charmingly domestic, refers to an invisible force field that prevents matter heated to temperatures exceeding 10,000 degrees Celsius from touching anything physical†. The designer's mantra, as famously articulated by Dr. Cassandra Webb after the Unfortunate Incident of 2089††, is now inscribed above every plasma weapons laboratory: "The bottle must not break, the bottle must NEVER break, and if you think the bottle might break, it has already broken."

The temperature differential between the plasma core and the weapon's exterior casing presents what the Institute of Thermodynamic Improbabilities has termed "a statistical obscenity"‡. We are, after all, attempting to maintain a substance that exists at temperatures comparable to the surface of the sun‡‡—approximately 15 million degrees Kelvin at full charge***—within a device meant to be carried comfortably in a standard-issue holster†††. This is roughly equivalent to storing a small piece of stellar core while ensuring the handle remains cool enough to touch without immediately converting one's palm into charcoal‡‡‡. The Ministry of Understated Warnings recommends treating this differential with "appropriate concern"****.

Plasma, that most temperamental fourth state of matter§, serves as our projectile—a choice that suggests either remarkable innovation or species-wide hubris§§. Unlike solid bullets, which have the decency to remain solid, or energy beams, which at least have the courtesy to be intangible, plasma combines the worst aspects of both: it desperately wants to expand†††† while simultaneously ionizing everything it touches. The process of firing plasma requires accelerating this temperamental substance through a magnetic acceleration corridor while simultaneously releasing the containment field in a controlled manner‡‡‡‡—a procedure that the Galactic Safety Board has rated as "technically possible, legally questionable, and aesthetically terrifying."§§§

Dr. Amara Chen's pioneering work on portable plasma containment serves as both inspiration and warning*****. Her first prototype, the MC-1, functioned flawlessly for approximately 4.7 seconds before the magnetic coils misaligned by 0.003 degrees—a margin of error that sounds admirably precise until one learns that it resulted in what is now officially termed "a regrettable spherical expansion event"†††††. Dr. Chen, displaying the pragmatic wisdom that would define her career, immediately redesigned every subsequent model with seventeen redundant safety systems‡‡‡‡‡, a panic shutdown that activates if the user sneezes too hard§§§§, and a casing made from material that the manufacturing specifications describe as "unreasonably thick."****** Her second prototype, the MC-2, successfully fired 847 times before catastrophic failure, which the research community celebrated as "a statistically significant improvement."


---FOOTNOTES---

*The ancient artificers of the Third Stellar Dynasty apparently achieved this literal feat, though their methods involved sacrificing entire planets to stellar-core entities whose names are, mercifully, unpronounceable. Modern plasma weapons are considerably more ethical and only slightly less dangerous. See Tertullian's "Gods Who Should Have Remained Hypothetical," Vol. 4, Chapter 12: "The Dynasty That Ended Surprisingly."

**The "bottle" metaphor was coined by Dr. Heinrich Faust in 2067, who reportedly thought it would make the technology sound "friendly and approachable." The subsequent three decades of magnetic containment failures suggest this was optimistic. The bottle, much like Pandora's jar before it, is best appreciated when firmly closed.

†For comparison, the surface of the sun reaches approximately 5,500 degrees Celsius. Plasma weapon cores operate at nearly double this temperature because, according to the design specifications, "if you're going to do something inadvisable, you might as well be thorough about it."

††The Unfortunate Incident of 2089 is officially classified, but the blast crater remains visible from orbital platforms. Dr. Webb survived by virtue of having left the laboratory 3.2 minutes earlier to acquire coffee—a timing so statistically improbable that the Institute of Temporal Anomalies investigated her for possible chronomancy. She was eventually cleared, though required to attend a seminar on "Appropriate Causal Relationships."

‡The full quote from the Institute's 2091 report reads: "The differential between plasma core and exterior handle represents a thermodynamic gradient so steep it appears on graphs as a vertical line, which our peer reviewers initially mistook for a printing error." It was not a printing error. The line remains vertical.

‡‡Though we hasten to note: the *surface* of the sun, not its core. We are not complete madmen. Core temperatures exceed 15 million degrees Kelvin, a figure so excessive that even weaponsmiths found it unreasonable. There are limits to human ambition, and they are approximately 10,000 degrees Celsius below solar core temperatures.

***At minimum charge. Maximum charge figures are classified at the request of the Pan-Stellar Insurance Consortium, who claimed the numbers gave their actuaries "existential episodes." One leaked memo described plasma weapons as "proof that sentience and survival instinct do not necessarily coincide."

†††The holster design specifications alone run to 847 pages, 734 of which concern thermal insulation. The remaining 113 pages detail what to do if the insulation fails, which can be summarized as "run perpendicular to the direction of melting" and "update your will."

‡‡‡Standard thermal protection involves seventeen layers of exotic materials with names like "impossibilium" and "absolutely-notium," several of which were discovered specifically to solve the plasma weapon cooling problem. One materials scientist described the research process as "starting with the question 'what doesn't melt?' and ending with 'apparently nothing, but some things melt slower.'"

****In the Ministry's defense, their full recommendation spans 2,400 pages and includes diagrams that caused three reviewers to require therapy. The "appropriate concern" summary represents admirable bureaucratic restraint.

§Plasma: the state of matter that occurs when you heat gas until the electrons give up on atomic structure entirely. It's the physical equivalent of a toddler's tantrum—energetic, uncontained, and capable of setting fire to things you didn't know could burn.§†

§†Including, according to Lab Incident Report 447-B, "the concept of safety" and "our insurance coverage." The insurance company subsequently refused to renew the policy, citing "philosophical objections to insuring impossibility."

§§The Ancient Plasmancers of the Kepler Cluster reportedly worshipped plasma as a minor deity of chaos and unintended consequences. Their civilization ended abruptly, and their ruins are still too radioactive to visit. This should perhaps have served as a warning.

††††Plasma wants to expand with what physicists describe as "unreasonable enthusiasm." At 15,000 degrees Celsius, plasma particles move fast enough that describing their velocity requires scientific notation and several exclamation marks. One researcher noted that plasma "expands like gossip in a small town, but considerably faster and with more explosive potential."

‡‡‡‡This is like opening an umbrella while simultaneously throwing it—a comparison that proved so apt that it appears in every plasma weapons manual, usually accompanied by the warning "but please don't actually try this analogy with your weapon."

§§§The Galactic Safety Board operates on a rating system from "mundane" to "apocalyptic." "Aesthetically terrifying" exists in a special category reserved for technologies that are theoretically safe but look horrifying in operation. Plasma weapons share this category with neurosurgical nanobots and the public transit system of Ganymede.

*****Dr. Amara Chen (2051-2157) pioneered portable plasma containment despite, or perhaps because of, the MC-1 incident. Her memoir, "Controlled Stellar Fire and Other Misnomers," became required reading for weapons engineers. The dedication reads: "To everyone who said it couldn't be done safely—you were absolutely right, but here we are anyway."

†††††Official reports describe "spherical expansion" to avoid using terms like "explosion" or "accidentally creating a miniature sun" or "that thing that scared the clouds away." The event was visible from the International Space Station, where astronauts reportedly filed a noise complaint.††††††

  description: `# Throwing Fire That Isn't Fire: Plasma Bolt Physics

The fundamental paradox of plasma projectile dynamics lies in its deliberate rejection of optimal velocity*. While coherent light weapons achieve near-instantaneous target acquisition, plasma bolts travel at a leisurely 847 meters per second**—slower than many conventional projectiles, yet infinitely more theatrical†. This apparent inefficiency conceals a profound tactical advantage: the plasma bolt is not merely a weapon but a delivery system for contained stellar matter††, maintained against the universe's fervent desire to see it dissipate†††. The projectile's relatively sedate pace allows for observable flight characteristics‡, which serves the dual purpose of psychological warfare and giving defenders that crucial 0.3 seconds to contemplate their life choices‡‡.

The physics of containment field decay presents what the Institute of Inadvisable Weaponry terms "the inevitable sunset problem"‡‡‡. Every plasma bolt emerges from its magnetic cradle with an expiration date§, typically measured in microseconds per meter traveled§§. The containment envelope—a delicate lattice of electromagnetic poetry holding several million degrees of ionized fury—degrades at a rate proportional to the square of the distance traveled§§§, atmospheric density, and something the equations call ξ which nobody has successfully defined*. At approximately 400 meters**, the field reaches what researchers euphemistically call "rapid unscheduled disassembly"††, though this clinical term fails to capture the magnificence of a plasma bolt achieving its final form***. The effective range must therefore balance lethality with the projectile's enthusiastic desire to become one with the atmosphere†††.

*The Guild of Unnecessary Sophistication in Warfare has documented 47 distinct reasons why slower is better, though reason #23 ("it looks really cool in slow motion") accounts for 63% of research funding. The remaining reasons include "gives targets time to regret their decisions" and "allows for mid-flight course correction," though the latter has only been successfully demonstrated once‡, and that researcher no longer speaks of it.

‡The incident at the Proving Grounds of Questionable Decisions involved Dr. Ellsworth Pemberton attempting to manually redirect a plasma bolt using a modified shepherd's crook. The bolt did indeed change course. So did Dr. Pemberton's career trajectory, primarily in a vertical direction. He survived, but his eyebrows did not§.

§The Dr. Pemberton Eyebrow Memorial Foundation now funds safer research into plasma dynamics. Their motto: "Learn from our mistakes, which were numerous."

**This specific velocity was determined after the Great Speed Trials of 2847, where the Institute tested everything from 200 m/s ("too much like throwing a really angry tennis ball") to 2,400 m/s ("the containment field just laughed at us and dissolved"). The optimal 847 m/s was discovered by Junior Researcher Mildred Cheng, who was actually aiming for 850 but sneezed during calibration††.

††Ms. Cheng received the Fortuitous Error Medal, Third Class. The ceremony was delayed by six months due to debates over whether a sneeze constituted "rigorous scientific methodology." The Journal of Serendipitous Discoveries published her paper anyway†††.

†††"Achoo!: A Novel Approach to Velocity Optimization in Plasma Projectile Systems" remains the most-cited paper in the field, primarily because researchers enjoy the footnote on page 47 where Cheng describes the committee's faces.

†The ancient texts speak of fire-that-walks and sun-shards thrown by angry gods‡. Modern plasma weapons are considerably less divine but maintain the same essential character: matter so offended by the concept of being room temperature that it actively attacks anything suggesting thermal equilibrium.

‡Modern archaeological evidence suggests these "gods" were possibly just very early plasma weapon researchers who lacked proper safety protocols§. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh contains a suspiciously detailed description of "sky-fire-that-travels-slowly-enough-to-see," complete with what appears to be an ancient lawsuit for property damage.

§The Council of Long-Ago Mistakes has seventeen volumes documenting prehistoric plasma weapon incidents. Volume 9 is just 400 pages of the word "ouch" in various ancient languages.

††Specifically, stellar corona material at approximately 4.7 million degrees Kelvin, though weaponized plasma is typically "cooled" to a mere 50,000 degrees to prevent the containment field from developing what physicists call "existential despair." The field equations literally include a term for "giving up."

†††This desire is encoded in the second law of thermodynamics, which plasma interprets as a personal challenge. Entropy isn't just a concept to plasma—it's a lifestyle choice it actively resists through what can only be described as thermodynamic spite‡.

‡Professor Malachi Stross of the University of Fundamental Forces once wrote: "Plasma doesn't want to be contained. It wants to be free. It wants to touch everything. Simultaneously. At several million degrees." He wrote this from a hospital bed after a containment failure, and his papers on the subject carry an unusual amount of emotional weight for physics journals.

‡‡The Temporal Psychological Warfare Division considers this the weapon's primary feature. Their research indicates that 83% of targets experience "acute existential dread" during the bolt's flight time, compared to only 12% with conventional weapons. The remaining 5% are either extremely brave or possess suboptimal survival instincts**. Interestingly, 67% of survivors report the experience as "oddly beautiful," though this may be the brain's self-defense mechanism against processing imminent vaporization.

**The Department of Survival Statistics maintains a "Wall of Noble Stupidity" featuring holograms of individuals who responded to incoming plasma bolts with actions ranging from "attempted to catch it" to "paused to take a photograph." These individuals are celebrated annually during the Festival of Educational Examples.

‡‡‡Named after the inevitable moment when even the most robust containment field must admit defeat and allow the plasma to pursue its dreams of thermal expansion. The Institute's Director, Dr. Yuki Tanaka, describes it as "the universe's way of reminding us that we're borrowing, not owning, this angry piece of star."

§Each plasma bolt is essentially a ticking clock made of electromagnetic fields and hubris†. The Guild of Optimistic Engineers attempted to extend this duration by reinforcing the containment lattice, resulting in what is now called the "Christmas Tree Incident" due to the festive light display‡ when twelve bolts simultaneously achieved cascade failure over the testing range.

†The ancient artificers of Mesopotamia understood this, crafting weapons they knew would fail—but at the right moment, in the right place, in the right enemy. There is a kind of poetry in building failure into success, though it's the sort of poetry that typically ends with explosions.

‡Visible from orbit. The International Committee on Really Obvious Mistakes sent a strongly worded letter. The testing range sent back a calendar featuring stunning photographs of the incident. It sold remarkably well.

§§The Institute for Measuring Things That Would Rather Not Be Measured has determined this through a combination of high-speed spectroscopy, advanced field sensors, and what they describe as "a truly inadvisable amount of trial and error." Their error bars are large enough to be visible from space, but they insist the measurements are "good enough for government work and better than anything our competitors have managed without losing as many graduate students."

§§§This is the polite version of the equation. The actual formula involves seventeen variables, four of which are Greek letters that don't officially exist‡, and a correction factor that varies based on the phase of the moon**. Professor Helena Vasquez of the Academy of Inconvenient Truths proved this mathematically in her landmark paper "Why Simple Things Aren't"††.

‡These letters (ξ, ϖ, ∂̃, and what looks like an angry theta with a hat) were invented specifically for plasma physics because existing mathematics was deemed "insufficiently intimidating." The International Mathematical Community objected. The plasma physicists pointed out that mathematics doesn't explode if you ignore it, but plasma does. Mathematics conceded the point.

**The lunar correction factor was discovered accidentally during a full moon testing session. The plasma bolts traveled 3.7% further than predicted. Researchers initially blamed instrumentation error until Dr. Benjamin Osei noticed the pattern and published "The Moon Is Meddling With Our Murder Spheres: A Lunar Tidal Effect on Electromagnetic Containment." The title alone won awards†††.

†††The Hemingway Prize for Directness in Scientific Communication, specifically.

  description: `# More Plasma, More Often: High-Rate Plasma Systems

The fundamental challenge of plasma weaponry has always been one of patience*. A single plasma bolt represents a triumph of applied thaumo-engineering: the containment field must be generated†, the plasma must reach operational temperature‡, and the projectile must be launched before the magnetic bottle degrades**. This process, undertaken with proper caution, requires approximately 2.3 seconds between shots††—an eternity in combat situations where the enemy is often inconsiderately mobile‡‡. The development of high-rate plasma systems, commonly called "plasma repeaters," represents humanity's eternal quest to solve problems by doing the same thing faster while ignoring all the warnings†††.

The first obstacle is fuel consumption***. A standard plasma weapon carries sufficient deuterium for approximately forty-seven shots†††, after which the operator must reload what is euphemistically called a "magazine" but which more accurately resembles a small fuel tank with delusions of grandeur‡‡‡. High-rate systems consume this supply in approximately eight seconds of continuous fire****—a discovery made by Lieutenant Hendricks of the Provisional Plasma Corps during the Battle of New Gloucester, who afterward commented that the experience was "exciting, then boring, then terrifying, in that order"****. Modern plasma repeaters address this through either enlarged fuel reservoirs††††, which make the weapon approximately as portable as a small filing cabinet, or through rapid-reload systems‡‡‡‡, which require a second operator and a degree of trust usually reserved for surgical teams.

The second obstacle is heat*****. Plasma weapons operate at temperatures that would make the surface of the sun feel overdressed†††††, and this heat must go somewhere between shots. Standard plasma weapons dissipate heat through radiator fins over those leisurely 2.3 seconds‡‡‡‡‡; high-rate systems do not have this luxury. The Kepler Institute's solution involves active cooling channels****** that circulate liquid helium through the weapon's containment chamber at what they describe as "brisk" but what operators describe as "suicidally optimistic" rates††††††. The alternative approach, championed by the late Dr. Yamamoto‡‡‡‡‡‡, involves accepting the heat buildup and designing weapons that can survive approximately ninety seconds of continuous operation before requiring either cooldown or replacement*******.

The third obstacle is the fundamental trade-off between rate and power*******. The plasma bolt's effectiveness derives from its temperature and cohesion, both of which require time to optimize††††††††. High-rate systems must choose between reducing charge time‡‡‡‡‡‡‡—producing cooler, less focused bolts—or accepting increased cycle times, which rather defeats the purpose********. The current compromise involves what weapons engineers call "suppressive fire capability," which translates roughly to "we admit these don't hurt as much individually, but we're making up for it in volume"********. Field reports suggest this approach is unexpectedly effective†††††††††, not because of the damage inflicted but because few enemies maintain tactical composure when subjected to a continuous stream of superheated plasma, regardless of its technical specifications‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. The psychological impact of plasma suppressive fire has been documented by the Department of Combat Psychology as "significant," "demoralizing," and "really quite rude"*********.

---

*The unofficial motto of the Society of Applied Plasma Dynamics is "Good Things Come to Those Who Wait, and Plasma Comes to Those Who Wait Slightly Longer." They had it inscribed on their ceremonial maces, which subsequently became too hot to hold during formal ceremonies due to residual plasma contamination. The irony was not lost on them.

†This process involves convincing magnetic fields to form a shape they find philosophically objectionable. Fields prefer to be diffuse and relaxed; making them into tight bottles requires what physicists call "aggressive persuasion" and what the fields would probably call "rude" if they could talk.

‡Specifically, to approximately 11,000°C, or as Professor Blackthorne of the Imperial Institute memorably put it, "hot enough to make atoms reconsider their life choices."

**The magnetic bottle degrades because plasma is, fundamentally, angry matter that wants to touch things and make them also become plasma. Containment is a temporary state, like sobriety at a conference or good intentions on a Monday.

††This figure represents the recommended interval according to the Weapons Safety Board, the Applied Physics Council, and every insurance company that has ever underwritten a plasma weapons facility. It is routinely ignored.

†††History is full of warnings that went unheeded. The phrase "what could possibly go wrong" appears in the preliminary notes of 73% of all catastrophic engineering failures, according to research by the Archive of Preventable Disasters§.

§The Archive is located in New Geneva and occupies seventeen buildings, which tells you everything you need to know about humanity's learning curve.

‡‡Enemies have consistently refused to stand still and wait their turn, despite numerous proposals submitted to the International Combat Conventions Committee. This is considered unsporting.

†††Unlike traditional firearms, where "rapid-fire modification" means adjusting a mechanical part, plasma weapons require "rapid-fire modification" of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, which are notably resistant to modification and tend to file formal complaints with the universe when pressed§§.

§§These complaints manifest as explosions, primarily.

***The amount required varies by model. The Lockheed-Pratchett Mark VII requires 470mL of deuterium per shot, which is precisely enough that you'll run out at the least convenient moment possible. This appears to be a fundamental law of combat engineering.

†††Dr. Elena Kowalski's thesis, "Magazine Capacity and the Illusion of Adequate Preparation," argued that no soldier in history has ever felt they had enough ammunition. The thesis was 847 pages long and included footnotes about footnotes about ammunition shortages§§§.

§§§One footnote discussed the Bronze Age Tin Crisis, in which the collapse of tin trade routes made bronze weapons scarce. Dr. Kowalski noted that even in 1200 BCE, soldiers probably complained about supply issues. Archaeological evidence supports this: cuneiform tablets from the period include phrases that translate roughly to "where is my bronze?"

‡‡‡The term "magazine" dates back to the Arabic "makhazin," meaning "storehouse," which originally referred to military supply depots and now refers to a small metal box you desperately wish held more bullets. The linguistic journey from "storehouse" to "thing you can hold in your hand" represents either human optimism or marketing genius.

****Hendricks' after-action report is preserved in the Archives of Tactical Lessons, filed under "Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time." The report includes the memorable phrase "turns out 'empty' sounds exactly like 'about to be overrun' but quieter."

*****Lieutenant Hendricks survived and was promoted, which sent exactly the wrong message to junior officers. The Provisional Plasma Corps now includes mandatory courses on "Fuel Management Under Stress" and "Recognizing When You're About To Do Something Stupid." Attendance is mandatory but effectiveness is debatable.

††††The Mk. XII "Sustained Fire" model features a fuel reservoir 300% larger than standard, which would be impressive if not for the fact that it also weighs 300% more. Operators report that carrying it feels like "hauling a drunk teenager who keeps getting heavier."

‡‡‡‡The rapid-reload system requires both operators to be moving at the same time, in the same direction, while one of them is holding something that contains pressurized deuterium and the other is holding something that makes pressurized deuterium into superheated death. The training manual's section on "trust exercises" is longer than the section on "basic operation"§§§§.

§§§§The trust exercises include "not dropping the fuel cell," "not tripping while your partner holds a plasma weapon," and "maintaining eye contact while discussing mortality." The graduation rate for two-person plasma teams is 73%, which is considered acceptable.

*****If plasma weapons were people, they would be those individuals who are always too hot at parties and stand near open windows while everyone else freezes. Except the weapon would also occasionally set the curtains on fire.

†††††The surface of the sun averages 5,500°C. Plasma weapons operate at twice that. This raises the philosophical question of why we're trying to hold pieces of technology hotter than the sun, but philosophy departments ceased engaging with weapons research after the Incident of 2089‡‡‡‡‡§.

  description: `# When You Need a Bigger Explosion: Heavy Plasma Weaponry

The fundamental principle of heavy plasma weaponry rests upon a simple observation made by the late Professor Hieronymus Blastworth*: if a small amount of superheated plasma can perforate armor, then a large amount of superheated plasma can perforate everything for several hundred feet in any direction. This paper examines the theoretical and practical considerations of scaling plasma weapon systems beyond what any reasonable engineer would consider advisable†, with particular attention to the unique challenges presented by weapons that generate their own exclusion zones‡.

The phenomenon of atmospheric area denial represents perhaps the most immediately obvious consequence of heavy plasma deployment**. When plasma fuel is combusted at industrial scales, the resulting temperature differential creates what the Thermodynamic Warfare Council euphemistically terms "a localized atmospheric inconvenience"††. In practice, this means that everything within the weapon's minimum range becomes simultaneously on fire, melting, and screaming‡‡. The Guild of Military Engineers maintains that this constitutes a "feature, not a bug"***, though survivors of the Incident at Thornbridge Fortress†† have been known to dispute this characterization with some vigor****.

The logistics of maintaining adequate plasma fuel supplies for heavy weaponry present challenges that go well beyond simple mathematics††††. A standard heavy plasma cannon requires approximately 847.3 pounds of refined plasma fuel per firing‡‡‡, which must be stored in containment vessels that themselves weigh more than most siege engines***. The fuel requires constant temperature regulation, periodic agitation to prevent crystallization, and what the Alchemists' Guild describes as "a respectful distance from anything you value"††‡. Historical attempts to economize on storage procedures have resulted in seventeen separate fortress explosions, twelve of which were the fortresses doing the economizing‡‡‡‡.

Perhaps no case study better illustrates the devastating potential of heavy plasma weaponry than the crater that used to be Stormwall Keep****. Prior to its enthusiastic transition from "imposing fortification" to "cautionary geology lesson"*****,  Stormwall was considered the most impregnable fortress in the Northern Territories†††. The defenders, confident in walls that had withstood conventional siege for three centuries, made the fatal error of assuming that historical precedent would protect them from contemporary innovation‡‡‡‡‡. The attacking force's heavy plasma cannon, lovingly nicknamed "The Conversation Ender" by its operators, required only a single shot to transform fourteen acres of military architecture into a smoking bowl of glass and regret******. Modern military doctrine now includes detailed protocols for surrendering before the enemy finishes assembling their plasma artillery†††‡.

In conclusion, heavy plasma weaponry represents the logical endpoint of humanity's ancient question: "What if we made it bigger?"******* The answer, as it turns out, involves significantly more melting than anyone initially anticipated‡‡‡‡‡‡, excellent life insurance policies for the operators*******, and a fundamental reconsideration of what constitutes a "safe distance"††††‡. While the technology remains experimental in the strictest sense, it has proven remarkably effective at converting solid objects into their constituent atoms, which was, after all, the stated goal‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

*Professor Blastworth's career was notable for his pioneering work in explosive research and his catastrophic inability to take his own safety advice. He is survived by his left boot, which was found three miles from the laboratory.

†The Reasonable Engineering Standards Committee has a very thick folder labeled "Heavy Plasma: Why We Said No." It is generally ignored by anyone with funding.

‡An exclusion zone is defined by military theorists as "an area where you should not be unless you enjoy the sensation of your component molecules achieving escape velocity."

**In technical terms, the weapon doesn't so much "fire" as "express its opinion very loudly in the general direction of the target."

††The full title is "The Thermodynamic Warfare Council for the Discussion of Things That Really Should Not Be Set On Fire But Here We Are."

‡‡This is one of the few occasions where the phrases "on fire," "melting," and "screaming" can be grammatically applied to both animate and inanimate objects simultaneously. The Council has a subcommittee dedicated to this linguistic phenomenon.

***This is documented in their technical manual under Section 47-B: "Regrettable But Effective Design Choices."

††††The sole survivor, a lance-corporal who happened to be on latrine duty three hundred yards from the fortress at the time of firing, later wrote a memoir titled "I Survived By Having Diarrhea: The Thornbridge Story." It sold poorly but is considered essential reading in military academies.

****The Guild actually has an entire chapter in their training manual dedicated to "Learning to Live With What You've Done," which suggests a level of institutional self-awareness rarely found in military organizations.

††††It's not just mathematics—it's the kind of mathematics that makes normal mathematicians weep and consider careers in poetry. The Thermodynamic Institute employs three full-time calculators whose sole job is determining blast radius equations. They require generous mental health benefits.

‡‡‡This is equivalent to approximately 4,237.4 standard combat rations, though plasma fuel is considerably less palatable and more explosive. The Guild tested this equivalence. Once.

***The record for "heaviest plasma containment vessel that has not yet killed anyone" stands at 4,700 pounds, maintained by the Ironforge Arsenal. The record for "heaviest plasma containment vessel" stands at 6,200 pounds, but that one killed seventeen people when it fell through the floor of the storage facility, so it doesn't count for the first category.

  description: `INDIRECT FIRE WITH THE FOURTH STATE OF MATTER: PLASMA CASTERS

The fundamental challenge in developing indirect fire capabilities for plasma-based weapon systems lies in maintaining coherent containment fields while the projectile traverses a parabolic trajectory through gravitational influence*. Unlike traditional ballistic projectiles, which remain helpfully inert until impact, plasma exhibits what the Alexandrian Institute for Energetic Studies euphemistically terms "an enthusiastic desire to expand in all available directions simultaneously"†. The solution, as documented extensively following the Incident at Fort Heliosdawn‡, requires a three-stage containment system: primary magnetic confinement (active), secondary gravitic stabilization (compensatory), and tertiary temporal release (catastrophically precise)**.

The mathematics of plasma artillery present unique complications absent from conventional ordnance. Standard ballistic calculations account for drag, wind resistance, and the Coriolis effect; plasma trajectory modeling must additionally consider containment field degradation rates (0.3% per second of flight time), magnetic interference from the planet's natural field††, thermal bloom dispersion (which increases logarithmically with altitude), and what Professor Erasmus Cinderholt termed "the plasma's apparent resentment at being thrown"‡‡. The Crimson College of Applied Devastation maintains that optimal firing solutions require calculating no fewer than forty-seven variables***†††, though the Guild of Practical Artillery Operators insists that seventeen will suffice "if you don't mind missing by up to three hundred yards"‡‡‡.

Timing the detonation represents perhaps the most critical—and lethal—aspect of plasma caster operation****. The containment field must release at the precise apex of the projectile's descent, allowing the plasma to expand into its natural state (which the Old Texts describe as "hungry") at maximum effect radius from the target††††. Release too early, and one achieves little more than an expensive light show‡‡‡‡; too late, and the plasma bolt impacts the ground with containment still active, producing what survivors invariably describe as "a disappointing fizzle followed by several tons of molten bedrock"*****. The Institute for Chronometric Warfare reports that the margin of error for optimal detonation timing is approximately 0.07 seconds†††††, which explains why plasma caster operators command salaries equivalent to senior surgical physicians and maintain similar insurance premiums‡‡‡‡‡.

The psychological impact of plasma artillery on besieged forces cannot be overstated. Unlike conventional siege weapons, which announce their presence through visible smoke, audible report, or the telltale thrum of charging capacitors, plasma casters fire with an almost ceremonial silence******. The first indication of incoming fire is typically a peculiar violet shimmer at altitude, followed by what witnesses describe as "the sky tearing itself open"†††††† or alternatively "the wrath of gods who specifically mentioned they wanted us dead"‡‡‡‡‡‡. The Siege of Blackstone Hold ended after precisely one shot********—not because the defenders surrendered immediately (though they did), but because the first plasma caster round, properly calibrated and timed, converted the keep's central tower into a crater of flash-fused glass approximately forty meters in diameter*******††††††††. The defending commander's surrender note, preserved in the Museum of Abbreviated Conflicts, consists of a single word: "Conceded."‡‡‡‡‡‡‡

Historical analysis suggests that plasma casters represent the logical endpoint of siege warfare evolution: a weapon system so devastating in application, so terrifying in effect, and so ruinously expensive to deploy that rational actors prefer negotiation*********. The Compact of Ashfall prohibits their use against civilian centers††††††††, though the definition of "civilian" has proven surprisingly elastic during certain documented conflicts‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. Contemporary military doctrine recommends plasma casters for "target-rich environments where collateral damage is not merely acceptable but potentially desirable"**********†††††††††, which largely limits their deployment to uninhabited fortifications, particularly stubborn mountain fastnesses, and at least one documented case involving a dragon that had ignored three separate eviction notices‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.


*Gravity, as the Ancient Mechanists observed, shows no favoritism toward any particular state of matter. It will pull solid, liquid, gas, and plasma downward with equal enthusiasm. Plasma simply complains about it more vocally.

†This desire manifests as temperatures exceeding 15,000 degrees Celsius and expansion velocities that would make a supernova feel inadequate. See Torchwell, M., "Why Plasma Containment Specialists Develop Nervous Tics: A Twenty-Year Longitudinal Study."

‡Fort Heliosdawn no longer exists in any meaningful sense. The crater, however, is spectacular and has become something of a tourist attraction. Local vendors sell commemorative postcards labeled "Wish You Weren't Here."

**The tertiary system's nickname among operators is "the Please Don't Fail Now" mechanism. This reflects both its critical importance and the widespread lack of confidence in its reliability. Failure rate statistics are classified, presumably to prevent panic.

††The planet's magnetic field, being somewhat miffed about artificially contained plasma passing through it, attempts to "correct" the trajectory. This correction is rarely helpful and frequently catastrophic. The phenomenon is technically termed "geomagnetic interference," but field operators call it "the planet's revenge."

‡‡Professor Cinderholt made this observation while treating severe burns acquired during the Battle of Scorched Plains. His exact words were considerably more colorful and involved several anatomical impossibilities regarding what the plasma could do to itself. The academic community later sanitized his language for publication.

***These variables include: initial plasma temperature, containment field strength, ambient air pressure, humidity (plasma reacts poorly to water vapor), lunar phase (disputed but included for historical reasons), operator's stress level (surprisingly relevant), and the metallurgical composition of the target. The full list requires three pages of dense notation.

†††The Guild's simplified approach works approximately 64% of the time, which they consider "perfectly acceptable odds for something that costs as much as a small castle." The remaining 36% represents what the insurance industry classifies as "regrettable incidents."

‡‡‡Missing by three hundred yards with a conventional catapult means hitting a different building. Missing by three hundred yards with a plasma caster means creating an entirely new geographical feature that cartographers will need to document.

****More operators die from mistimed detonations than from enemy action, equipment failure, and accidental self-immolation combined. The Operators' Union has been lobbying for better safety protocols since the Year of Abbreviated Careers (historical records are unclear about what happened that year, but memorial plaques are suspiciously numerous).

††††The Old Texts, discovered in the Obsidian Libraries, contain disturbingly accurate descriptions of plasma behavior written in the First Language. Scholars debate whether this represents lost ancient knowledge or evidence that previous civilizations also learned about plasma artillery the hard way. Archaeological evidence suggests the latter.

‡‡‡‡The light show is admittedly beautiful—a cascade of violet, blue, and white that illuminates the sky like aurora borealis designed by someone with anger management issues. Spectators often applaud. The artillery commander rarely shares their enthusiasm.

*****The molten bedrock, once cooled, forms interesting geometric patterns that have caught the attention of the Geological Society. Several "failed" plasma shots are now protected landmarks, which provides small comfort to the operators who caused them and were subsequently reassigned to conventional ballista duty.

†††††For context, 0.07 seconds is less time than it takes to blink. Plasma caster operators train extensively to develop what instructors call "supernatural timing" and what psychologists call "obsessive-compulsive disorder focused on extremely specific intervals." Both descriptions are accurate.

‡‡‡‡‡The insurance premiums also include coverage for "catastrophic premature detonation," "accidental reversal of containment polarity," and "that thing that happened at the Proving Grounds that we agreed never to discuss in public." Actuaries who specialize in plasma artillery insurance require therapy at rates 340% above the professional average.

******The silence results from containment fields suppressing the usual acoustic signatures of superheated plasma. The effect is deeply unnerving—witnesses report feeling that reality has become too quiet, as though the universe is holding its breath before delivering extremely bad news.

††††††The violet shimmer occurs when atmospheric molecules begin ionizing in response to the descending plasma bolt's electromagnetic signature. By the time you see it, you have approximately 1.3 seconds to make peace with your life choices. Experts recommend using this time for prayer, sprinting, or both simultaneously.`,

  description: `# Making Atoms Go Very Fast Indeed: Particle Weapon Fundamentals

When one considers the fundamental problem of convincing matter to move at appreciable fractions of the speed of light*, the traditional approaches—gunpowder, compressed gas, vigorous shoving—reveal themselves to be rather quaint†. The modern practitioner of applied violence must instead turn to the electromagnetic acceleration of subatomic particles, a field which combines the theoretical elegance of quantum mechanics with the practical elegance of making things very, very dead‡. Dr. Cassandra Heisenberg-Feynman**, the noted particle physicist who famously declared "I got tired of discovering things that don't kill anyone"††, pioneered the miniaturization of linear accelerator technology to the point where one could, theoretically, fit a device capable of achieving 0.6c particle velocities into something resembling a large handgun‡‡. This achievement required seventeen years, four hundred million dollars in research funding, and what the Board of Directors later described as "an alarming disregard for the spirit of our original research grant"***.

The physics underlying particle weapons is deceptively straightforward: accelerate something small to relativistic velocities, point it at something you dislike, and observe the subsequent conversion of kinetic energy into what weapons designers technically refer to as "an absolute mess"†††. At velocities approaching significant fractions of light speed, the relativistic mass increase means that even a single proton carries sufficient energy to penetrate any known armor‡‡‡**, and the subsequent particle cascade as it interacts with matter creates a damage channel that makes traditional ballistics look like strongly worded letters***. The armor, you see, was designed with the optimistic assumption that projectiles would travel at merely supersonic speeds, not at velocities where time dilation becomes a practical concern††††. Testing revealed that tank armor, when struck by a relativistic proton beam, experienced what Dr. Heisenberg-Feynman's team described as "comprehensive structural re-evaluation"‡‡‡‡.

The primary limitation of particle weapons, and the reason they have not replaced conventional firearms despite their obvious superiority in the "making holes in things" department, is the minor issue of power requirements****. A single shot from a properly miniaturized particle pistol requires approximately 2.7 megajoules of energy*****—roughly equivalent to the energy content of a substantial breakfast††††† or the complete discharge of batteries that weigh more than most humans‡‡‡‡‡. The Grand Academy of Applied Physics calculated that to fire ten shots, the average user would need to carry a power supply weighing approximately forty-seven kilograms, assuming superconducting capacitors operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures******. This created what engineers refer to as "the backpack problem"*******—specifically, that no soldier particularly enjoys going into battle resembling a mobile refrigeration unit. The eventual solution involved discovering a new form of energy storage that the patent office initially rejected on the grounds that it "violated several fundamental principles and possibly good taste"††††††.

Dr. Heisenberg-Feynman's contribution to weaponized particle physics extended beyond mere technical innovation; she also established the safety protocols that have prevented approximately 87.3% of the incidents that would otherwise have occurred‡‡‡‡‡‡. Her seminal paper, "Please Stop Pointing Linear Accelerators at Each Other: A Plea for Laboratory Sanity," became required reading at research institutions worldwide********, though it notably failed to prevent the Incident at Los Alamos III†††††††, the Less-Than-Geneva-Convention-Compliant Experiments of 2047‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, or what historians simply call "That Business with the Miniature Black Hole"*********. The current safety standards require that all particle weapon research be conducted in facilities located at least two hundred meters underground, surrounded by seventeen different types of shielding, and staffed entirely by people who have made their peace with the universe**********.

*Approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, give or take. The "give or take" is important; it's the difference between "impressively fast" and "uncomfortably relativistic." See also: Einstein's increasingly frantic letters to colleagues about proper citation practices.

†The Guild of Antiquated Weapon Enthusiasts filed a formal complaint about this characterization. They were ignored, as is traditional.

‡The Philosophical Society for the Ethical Application of Physics requested this sentence be revised. The request was declined on the grounds that ethics and particle weapons have only a nodding acquaintance, and they don't particularly like each other.

††This quote was actually delivered during her Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which makes it one of the more awkward moments in Nobel Prize history. The committee had awarded her the Physics Prize for her work on quantum tunneling effects; they were not aware she had spent the previous three years applying this knowledge to weapon development. The look on the Swedish King's face has been described as "complex."

‡‡Specifically, something resembling a large handgun if that handgun had been designed by someone who had only ever heard handguns described via telegram and was working from increasingly frantic sketches†††. The first prototype weighed 14.7 kilograms and required a bipod.

†††These sketches are now housed in the Museum of Questionable Engineering Decisions in Bavaria‡. They include helpful annotations like "probably some kind of trigger here?" and "bit that makes the science happen."

‡The museum itself is built into an underground bunker, as approximately 40% of its exhibits are still theoretically dangerous. Visitors must sign a waiver acknowledging that they understand "the historical nature of the weapons does not render them incapable of harm."

***The original grant proposal, submitted to the Department of Energy, was for "improved particle detection methods in high-energy physics experiments." The legal settlement that followed Dr. Heisenberg-Feynman's departure from Los Alamos National Laboratory included a clause requiring her to "please read grant proposals more carefully in future" and to "stop weaponizing things for at least eighteen months."

†††Technical terminology from Dr. Heisenberg-Feynman's field notes. The peer reviewers requested more formal language. She responded by changing it to "comprehensive structural deconstruction," which the reviewers felt was "not really an improvement."

‡‡‡At these velocities, the distinction between "solid matter" and "temporary obstacles" becomes somewhat philosophical. The Ancient Brotherhood of Target Practice††††† has preserved recordings of ballistic gel tests that had to be watched frame-by-frame because the event lasted approximately 0.0003 seconds in real-time.

††††††The Brotherhood, founded in 1547, has been testing weapons for nearly five centuries. Their motto, "Someone Has to Try It First," is carved above their firing range in seventeen languages, six of which are dead languages from civilizations that apparently tried things first too enthusiastically.

††††At this point, the projectile experiences time at a measurably different rate than the target. This has led to philosophical debates at weapons conferences about whether the particle "knows" it has hit something, or whether, from the particle's reference frame, the universe has simply moved into its path very rapidly. These debates typically occur during the after-dinner drinks portion of the conference.

  description: `# A Very Thin Line of Destruction: Precision Particle Beams

In the evolution of particle weaponry, the transition from "energetic spray" to "coherent stream of concentrated annoyance" represents perhaps the most significant advancement since someone first realized that accelerating things at other things constituted a viable military strategy*. The fundamental challenge lies not in generating sufficient particles—modern accelerators can produce them with the enthusiasm of a baker making crumbs—but rather in convincing these particles to travel in approximately the same direction for more than a few meters†. The physics of beam coherence at combat ranges involves a delicate interplay between electromagnetic confinement, quantum mechanical effects that particles find deeply inconvenient‡, and what practitioners euphemistically term "aggressive trajectory correction"**.

The question "why do these shots go through things?" possesses a deceptively simple answer that belies centuries of experimental tragedy††. At the quantum level, matter is predominantly empty space, a fact that atoms find somewhat embarrassing when particle beams exploit this architectural oversight†††. A properly focused particle stream achieves penetration through a combination of kinetic energy transfer, electromagnetic disruption, and what ancient practitioners might have called "aggressive molecular negotiation"‡‡. The beam does not so much "cut" as "convince matter to stop being matter in that particular location," a process involving ionization cascades, thermal shock, and the sort of material phase transitions that would make a thermodynamicist weep‡‡‡.

The engineering of maximum penetration requires attention to beam diameter, particle velocity, and temporal coherence—the latter being the particle beam's equivalent of keeping one's thoughts focused during a philosophical debate***, if the debate were conducted at 99.7% of light speed and both participants were protons. Modern military-grade particle rifles maintain beam diameters under 0.3 millimeters at ranges exceeding five hundred meters†††, a precision that early researchers would have considered either miraculous or fictional‡‡. The Imperial Bureau of Directed Energy Standards maintains that properly calibrated weapons should be capable of "threading a needle at fifty paces, then continuing through seventeen walls, three support beams, and most varieties of personal armor"††**.

Perhaps most fascinating are the mechanisms by which focused particle beams produce what battlefield reports classify as "critical hits"‡‡‡‡. At the subatomic level, a concentrated particle stream doesn't merely transfer energy—it fundamentally reorganizes matter's social structure, disrupting molecular bonds with the efficiency of a determined bureaucrat armed with the correct forms****. The phenomenon of "cascade failure," wherein initial particle impacts trigger secondary ionizations which prompt tertiary disintegrations, can result in damage significantly disproportionate to the beam's apparent energy content†††††. This has led to the development of sophisticated targeting systems designed to identify and exploit structural weaknesses in target materials, a practice the Guild of Ethical Warfare has termed "technically not cheating"‡‡‡‡‡.

The practical application of these principles in handheld particle rifles represents the culmination of decades of research, thousands of test subjects******, and at least one incident we're not supposed to mention but which fundamentally changed our understanding of what happens when beam coherence fails at exactly the wrong moment†††††. Modern weapons incorporate real-time coherence monitoring, automatic beam correction, and what manufacturers describe as "comprehensive operator survival features"—a category of safety mechanisms that speaks volumes about the early development process‡‡‡‡‡‡.

*The Historical Archives of Violence Innovation credit this discovery to approximately every culture simultaneously, though the Mesopotamians claim priority based on their early experiments with "throwing rocks really hard." The Society of Anachronistic Weapons Technology disputes this, citing evidence of prehistoric particle acceleration in cave paintings that, upon closer inspection, might just be paintings of spears. The debate continues, as academic debates tend to do, long past the point of relevance**.

**See the delightful work of Professor Thaddeus Marginalnote's eighteen-volume treatise "Things What Move Fast and the People Who Made Them Do That." Volume twelve is entirely devoted to historical arguments about who did what first, and is notably longer than volumes one through eleven combined†.

†The record for maintained coherence in early particle weapons stood at approximately 2.7 meters, achieved by the Vladivostok Institute of Ambitious Physics in 1947. This record was celebrated for nearly three hours before someone noticed that the beam hadn't actually stopped at 2.7 meters—it had simply become so incoherent that measuring equipment could no longer detect it as a discrete phenomenon. The beam was eventually located in 1953, having wandered through six buildings and several theoretical impossibilities before coming to rest in a janitor's closet, where it was described as "still technically going"††.

††The Institute's official report noted: "Further research required." The janitor's report noted: "Please stop doing physics in my closet."

‡Particles, when left to their own devices, exhibit what physicists call "natural divergence" and what weapons designers call "the reason prototypes keep missing." The phenomenon occurs because particles, despite their lack of consciousness, appear to possess an almost willful tendency to explore alternative trajectories. The Heisenberg Institute of Reluctant Certainty published a paper suggesting that particles might actually *prefer* not to travel in straight lines, though this remains controversial‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

**"Aggressive trajectory correction" involves electromagnetic fields of such intensity that particles find themselves with limited career options beyond "continue in this exact direction." The technique was perfected by Dr. Yuki Strongfield of the Tokyo Institute for Convincing Particles, whose motivational speeches to particle streams included phrases like "you will go exactly there" and "your quantum uncertainty is not welcome here." Success rates improved dramatically‡.

‡Dr. Strongfield's techniques were later adapted for use in corporate management training, with mixed results.

††The Guild of Applied Violence Inquiry maintains an archive of "Incidents Involving Insufficient Understanding of Penetration Mechanics." This archive occupies three buildings, requires security clearance level 7 or higher to access, and includes a subsection titled "But We Thought It Would Stop" that alone spans fourteen thousand documented cases†††††.

†††The experimental phase of penetration research produced what historians call "the Century of Regrettable Holes," during which various research institutions, military facilities, and at least one unfortunate cathedral discovered that early particle weapons possessed penetration capabilities far exceeding their designers' wildest expectations or, indeed, desires******.

‡‡See the foundational work of Professor Wilhelmina Throughput, whose 1967 paper "On the Unexpected Persistence of Directed Particle Streams Through Materials Previously Considered Solid" effectively invented the field of penetration mechanics. Her follow-up paper, "No, Really, It Just Kept Going," remains the most-cited work in the field*******.

‡‡‡The precise mechanism involves what thermodynamicists call "rapid phase transition" and what target materials call "a very bad day." Temperatures at the beam impact site can briefly exceed those found in stellar cores, leading to matter states not typically encountered in terrestrial environments. The Consortium for Exotic Matter States has classified seventeen previously unknown phases of matter discovered solely through particle beam impact studies, most of which exist for less than a nanosecond and all of which are deeply unstable**.

***This analogy was proposed by Dr. Marcus Metaphor of the Institute for Making Physics Understandable to People Who Would Rather Not. His work earned him both the Nobel Prize in Pedagogical Creativity and a stern letter from the Council of Actual Philosophers pointing out that philosophical debates rarely involve c-fractional velocities†.

†Though they noted that perhaps they should.

†††This specification, maintained by the International Bureau of Uncomfortable Precision, arose from the Incident of 2094, when a military contractor's quality control department discovered that seventeen production models were maintaining 0.31-millimeter beam diameters at five hundred meters. The entire production run was recalled, retested, and eventually destroyed after testing revealed that users had difficulty distinguishing between "accurate enough" and "accurate to specification." The Bureau's report concluded with the memorable line: "Precision is not a suggestion"††.

††The full report spans 1,247 pages. The line appears on page 1,246, suggesting either remarkable patience or remarkable ability to avoid reaching conclusions.

‡‡Early researchers considered such precision impossible, probable, and then mandatory, in that order. The transition from "impossible" to "probable" occurred during the demonstration phase of Project Threadneedle, when Dr. Sarah Exactitude successfully threaded, if not an actual needle, then at least a needle-adjacent aperture measuring 0.4 millimeters in diameter. The transition to "mandatory" occurred approximately forty seconds later when the beam continued through the needle, the demonstration stand, the laboratory floor, and three basement levels before achieving what impact assessment teams later described as "unscheduled basement`,

  description: `# Bigger Particles, Faster: Heavy Particle Weapons

The scaling of particle accelerators from laboratory curiosities to portable weaponry represents one of the more spectacular failures of the Institutional Review Board system*. While traditional particle physics concerns itself with the discovery of fundamental particles through careful experimentation, the weaponization of such systems focuses primarily on the efficiency with which one can convert matter into extremely regrettable tactical decisions†. The theoretical foundation rests upon a simple principle: if a single proton traveling at 0.9999c can penetrate seventeen meters of lead shielding, imagine what a stream of iron nuclei could do‡. The answer, as discovered by the research team at the Blackwood Munitions Laboratory in 2047, is "too much."**

Desktop-sized synchrotrons†† presented unique engineering challenges, chief among them the ratio of "functional acceleration ring" to "catastrophic magnetic field collapse."‡‡ Early prototypes achieved a concerning 1:7 success rate, which the manufacturers optimistically termed "within acceptable parameters for experimental weaponry."*** The breakthrough came with the development of crystalline superconductors derived from what the procurement documents carefully labeled as "ethically ambiguous mining operations"††† - a phrase that typically indicates someone excavated something that was perfectly happy remaining unexcavated‡‡‡. The resulting accelerators could fit in a standard military footlocker**** and achieve particle energies previously requiring facilities the size of small countries, though the instruction manual's warning section occupied 847 pages††††.

The penetration characteristics of heavy-ion streams exceeded all predictions, mostly because the predictions had been made by people who assumed others would exercise basic common sense‡‡‡‡. Standard battlefield armor, designed to stop kinetic projectiles and shaped charges, proved as effective against accelerated uranium nuclei as a strongly worded letter proves against a meteorite*****. The infamous "Phantom Tank Incident"****** demonstrated penetration values of 47.3 meters through combined armor, crew, engine block, and the moderately unfortunate hill behind the target, creating what eyewitnesses described as "a very straight tunnel through which one could observe the tactical situation on the far side."†††††† The optical properties of such wounds - both to equipment and personnel - remain a subject of ongoing trauma counseling‡‡‡‡‡.

The accidental discovery of the zeta-minus particle******* during what was supposed to be a routine field test proves that scientific advancement and criminal negligence can occupy the same moment in spacetime********. The weapon, a Mark VII "Peacemaker" heavy accelerator†††††††, was being tested against a target consisting of layered depleted uranium, lead, and concrete - a combination specified by someone who had clearly never considered what happens when you compress forty years of particle physics into three seconds‡‡‡‡‡‡. The resulting particle cascade contained an unexpected resonance at 847.3 GeV, indicating either a new fundamental particle or a very confused cluster of existing ones*********. The discovery earned a Nobel Prize; the cleanup earned a superfund designation**********.

Contemporary research focuses on preventing such devices from falling into the hands of anyone, including the people who built them in the first place††††††††. The theoretical maximum for portable accelerators remains unknown, primarily because everyone involved in finding it is now required to attend mandatory ethics seminars‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. The Guild of Responsible Physicists maintains that any technology capable of making objects transparent through the application of concentrated atomic violence should perhaps remain theoretical***********. This position has not stopped seventeen nations from maintaining active development programs, though they have agreed to not test them near population centers************, archaeological sites*************,  or that one specific valley in Switzerland that has experienced quite enough already**************.

*The IRB, upon reviewing the initial proposal, responded with a single word: "No." When the research proceeded anyway, they amended this to "NO" in forty-point font, followed by a twelve-page explanation of why this was a terrible idea. The researchers apparently interpreted this as "enthusiastic support pending minor revisions."

†The Department of Euphemistic Nomenclature worked overtime to describe these devices as anything other than "guns that shoot atoms very hard." Suggested alternatives included "Kinetic Particle Reorganization Systems," "Tactical Subatomic Adjustment Devices," and the deeply concerning "Molecular Democracy Enforcers."

  description: `THE LINE THAT DOESN'T STOP: SUSTAINED ENERGY BEAMS

In the annals of weapons development, few achievements have generated as much raw enthusiasm—and subsequent property damage*—as the sustained energy beam. Unlike pulsed energy weapons, which operate on the reassuringly discrete principle of "fire, pause, fire again," continuous beam weapons represent humanity's finest achievement in the field of "what if we just never stopped?"** The fundamental challenge lies not in generating sufficient power†, but rather in maintaining that power without creating what the Engineering Guild delicately refers to as "unplanned thermal events"††. The development of stable continuous beam systems required advances in power management‡, beam coherence maintenance‡‡, thermal dissipation‡‡‡, and most critically, operator psychology†††.

The power requirements for a sustained beam weapon make conventional energy sources look like birthday candles trying to illuminate a cathedral*. A Mark VII Continuous Projector draws approximately 847 megawatts during standard operation**, which represents enough energy to power a small city, run three industrial fabrication complexes, or—as the infamous Meridian Incident demonstrated††—reshape local geography in ways that cartographers find deeply upsetting†††. Modern fusion reactors, which had previously considered themselves quite impressive‡, now find themselves working at maximum capacity simply to keep the beams running‡‡. The relationship between operator and power source has been compared to an ancient pact between mortal and god‡‡‡, though the gods in question are typically more cooperative and less likely to trigger emergency shutdowns*.

The tactical advantages of continuous beam operation extend far beyond the obvious "point and hold" methodology**. Sweeping techniques allow a single operator to engage multiple targets without the reload cycles that characterize conventional systems†, creating what military theorists call "persistent engagement zones"†† and what everyone else calls "the area you absolutely should not enter under any circumstances"†††. The beam's sustained nature permits precision work impossible with pulsed systems‡; skilled operators can trace complex patterns‡‡, bisect hardened structures with surgical precision‡‡‡, or—as Operator Third Class Helena Vross famously demonstrated*—sign their name on the side of Mount Thelian in letters visible from low orbit**.

Perhaps the most underestimated aspect of continuous beam operation is its profound psychological impact on both operator and observer***. Holding a weapon that requires unbroken concentration for potentially minutes at a time† creates unique mental states that the Institute for Thaumaturgical Psychology has termed "the sustained focus paradox"††. Operators report entering flow states of unusual depth†††, occasionally emerging from extended firing sequences with little memory of the elapsed time and a surprising tendency to have composed poetry‡. The effect on those witnessing continuous beam deployment is equally notable; there is something primal and terrible about a light that does not blink, does not pause, and does not suggest any intention of stopping‡‡. It was the study of these psychological factors that led to the establishment of the now-mandatory Continuous Beam Operator Evaluation Program‡‡‡, instituted after what official reports still refer to only as "the Vross Situation"*.

Current research focuses on extending operational duration beyond the current theoretical maximum of seventeen minutes**, though whether this represents genuine progress or catastrophic overconfidence remains a subject of heated debate among those who survived the initial field tests††. The integration of advanced cooling systems†††, metamaterial beam guides‡, and what engineers optimistically call "probability-defying thermal dynamics"‡‡ has pushed sustained operation times to levels that make fusion engineers visibly nervous‡‡‡. The future of continuous beam technology appears bright*, though one should probably not look directly at it**, and certainly not for sustained periods***.


FOOTNOTES:

* The Farland Defense Proving Grounds still bear the distinctive melted glass formations from the first successful ten-second sustained beam test in 1247 PE. They have become something of a tourist attraction, though visitors are advised not to touch them, as they remain warm to this day. The Proving Grounds Commission has officially declared them "probably not actively dangerous anymore."

** This approach was first proposed by Engineer Tomás Breskin in a paper titled "Continuous Energy Projection: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?" History has provided several detailed answers to this question, none of them reassuring.

Humanity has been quite good at making large amounts of energy ever since someone discovered that splitting atoms was both possible and entertainingly dramatic. It's what you do with that energy afterward that separates the professionals from the scorch marks.

†† The official definition of "unplanned thermal event" includes, but is not limited to: uncontrolled plasma venting, sympathetic detonation of cooling systems, spontaneous conversion of nearby matter into exotic states, unexpected phase transitions in structural materials, and what one report simply described as "the glowing." The Engineering Guild maintains a surprisingly thick manual on the subject.

‡ The Breskin-Morrow Power Coupling Matrix, developed after the spectacular failure of every previous coupling system. Morrow's contribution was primarily insisting that the components should be rated for at least twice the theoretical maximum load, a suggestion that Breskin initially dismissed as "overcautious paranoia" before the Fourth Prototype Incident changed his mind and several ceiling tiles.

‡‡ Maintaining beam coherence over sustained periods requires constant micro-adjustments measured in picoseconds. This task was initially handled by human operators, which resulted in what medical journals called "unprecedented rates of neural fatigue." Modern systems employ dedicated quantum processors, which presumably also get tired but lack the ability to file complaints.

‡‡‡ The cooling systems for a Mark VII Continuous Projector contain more exotic coolants than a Thermal Engineers' Convention cocktail party. The primary loop uses liquid helium, the secondary employs a proprietary mixture that the manufacturers refuse to fully disclose (though it definitely smells like almonds†), and the tertiary system operates on principles that the designers describe as "theoretical" and "probably fine."

† Leading some to suspect the coolant contains compounds related to cyanide, which the manufacturers neither confirm nor deny, instead referring all inquiries to their legal department and suggesting that maintenance personnel "not worry about it."

††† The training regimen for continuous beam operators includes meditation techniques borrowed from various mystical traditions, none of whom seem particularly pleased about this appropriation. The Monastery of the Eternal Flame has sent several strongly worded letters.

* When the prototype fusion reactor at the Meridian Testing Facility was first connected to a continuous beam weapon, the reactor's monitoring staff reported feeling "an unfamiliar sensation of purpose, as if the reactor had finally found its true calling." Previous to this, the reactor had been primarily employed making electricity, which it performed with what staff described as "barely concealed disdain."

** This figure represents 99.97% of the reactor's rated maximum output. The remaining 0.03% is reserved for life support, lighting, and the coffee machines. In emergency situations, even these can be sacrificed, though the Union of Reactor Operators has made it clear that coffee is to be the last thing cut.

†† The Meridian Incident of 1251 PE, in which a sustained beam test was allowed to run for "just a few seconds longer than recommended" and resulted in the creation of a new valley where a hill had previously stood. The hill, named Proctor's Rise after the local landowner, is now Proctor's Memorial Depression. Mr. Proctor was fortunately elsewhere at the time, though his sheep were not. The official inquiry lasted longer than the beam test itself.

††† The Cartographers' Guild issued a formal complaint, as the incident occurred three days before their new regional maps were scheduled for publication.

Its operators still speak wistfully of the days when their biggest concern was "routine maintenance" rather than "preventing the formation of new types of plasma."

‡‡ Contemporary reports suggest the reactors view this as beneath their dignity, though as inanimate objects, their opinions are largely inferred from their tendency to trigger warning alarms during particularly demanding operations. Engineers interpret these as "stress responses," though some claim the reactors are simply "being difficult."

  description: `A RIVER OF FIRE: CONTINUOUS PLASMA PROJECTION

The transition from discrete plasma manifestation to sustained beam projection represents what the Flamekeepers' Guild diplomatically terms "a significant escalation in operational hazard parameters."* The fundamental challenge lies not in generating plasma—which any competent practitioner can achieve with sufficient preparation and adequate fire insurance**—but in maintaining coherent projection over durations exceeding three seconds without catastrophic containment failure.*** The theoretical framework, first articulated by Master Pyromancer Embris the Flame-Touched† in his final publication, requires simultaneous mastery of three interlocking disciplines: continuous energy channeling at rates that would make municipal power authorities weep††, magnetic containment field generation strong enough to deflect compass needles within a hundred yards†††, and what the technical literature euphemistically describes as "thermal dissipation management."‡

The containment apparatus itself functions on principles that seem to violate several fundamental laws of thermodynamics, though Professor Helix Magnetwhistle of the Perpetual University argues these laws were "more what you'd call guidelines anyway."‡‡ A continuous plasma beam requires maintaining a stable magnetic bottle that moves‡‡‡—an engineering challenge roughly equivalent to juggling soap bubbles while riding a unicycle during an earthquake.§ The plasma itself, being ionized matter at temperatures approaching those found in stellar coronae§§, possesses what researchers call "aggressive spatial negotiation characteristics"—it wants very much to be elsewhere, preferably everywhere at once, and objects strenuously to remaining in beam form.§§§ The proximity effect alone renders the weapon system operationally awkward; objects within fifteen feet of the beam path begin experiencing what insurance adjusters classify as "sympathetic thermal events."*

This sympathetic heating represents perhaps the most underappreciated hazard of continuous plasma projection.** Any matter within the affected radius—be it stone, steel, or the operating platform itself—begins absorbing thermal energy at rates that transform "standing ground" into "standing liquid" with distressing rapidity.*** The famous incident at the Scorched Tower Proving Grounds††† demonstrated this principle when test subject Magus Pyrrhus successfully maintained a beam for seventeen seconds, setting a record that stood for three years.‡‡‡ What made the achievement particularly memorable was not the record itself but the subsequent discovery that the stone floor had become translucent and the observation gallery's brass railings had achieved the consistency of warm honey.§§§ The Guild of Structural Engineers has since published extensive guidelines on "acceptable substrate liquefaction parameters," a document that begins with the words "If you must" and only grows more pessimistic from there.**

The fuel consumption rates achieve what the Department of Resource Management describes as "fiscally catastrophic" within the first thirty seconds of operation.*** A continuous plasma beam consumes magical energy at approximately seven hundred standardized thaumic units per second††—roughly equivalent to the daily output of a medium-sized ley line node, or the amount of energy required to levitate seventeen elephants indefinitely.††† This helps explain why operational doctrine strictly limits continuous projection to "absolutely necessary," "probably too late anyway," or "the insurance has already been canceled" scenarios.‡‡‡ The Confederation of Fire Marshals, upon reviewing the specifications, issued a formal statement consisting entirely of the word "NO" in letters three feet high, followed by several pages of increasingly panicked subclauses.§§§§

Perhaps most tellingly, the device's very existence has spawned an entirely new branch of municipal regulation.* The Guild of Firefighters—those stalwart souls who routinely tackle burning buildings and magical conflagrations—maintains a special emergency protocol specifically for plasma beam incidents.** This protocol consists primarily of establishing a perimeter, evacuating everyone within a quarter mile, and waiting for either the fuel supply to exhaust itself or the operator to achieve what the documentation politely terms "thermal equilibrium with the environment."*** The few successful operational deployments have entered tactical doctrine under the classification "Weapons of Last Resort (Category: Please Don't),"†† a designation shared only with weaponized chaos theory and the notorious Infinity Catapult.††† Modern practitioners regard continuous plasma projection with a mixture of professional respect and personal terror—rather like one might regard a tiger that has learned to use door handles and developed a fondness for the taste of wizards.‡‡‡


* The Guild is institutionally incapable of using phrases like "monumentally dangerous" or "please stop doing this," having been founded by individuals who considered understatement a virtue and property damage a lifestyle choice. Their safety guidelines read like inverse instruction manuals: if they suggest "adequate ventilation," they mean "preferably outdoors, ideally in a desert, possibly on another plane of existence."

** The author wishes to note that "adequate fire insurance" is increasingly difficult to obtain. The Underwriters' Collective has recently introduced a clause specifically excluding "damage arising from the sustained projection of matter existing in the fourth state, howsoever achieved." They got very specific after the Flamebridge incident.† Upon being asked to clarify what would be covered, the senior underwriter reportedly whispered "nothing" and began drinking heavily.

*** Technical literature defines "catastrophic containment failure" as any event requiring the fire brigade, the structural engineers, and/or the clergy. Events requiring all three are classified as "catastrophic containment failure with aggravating circumstances" and trigger automatic investigation by the Council of Thaumaturgical Safety, who arrive wearing expressions of weary inevitability.

† Master Embris disappeared during his demonstration of a "perfectly safe" continuous beam that he claimed could be maintained indefinitely. The scorch mark is still visible from low orbit.†† His last words, preserved by a recording crystal, were "You see? Stable as—" followed by a sound the transcriptionist described as "the universe clearing its throat forcefully." His estate has been in litigation with the Firefighters' Guild for seventeen years regarding cleanup costs.

†† The mark has actually faded considerably. It was initially visible from other planets.

††† The Flamekeepers maintain a "Directional Accuracy Hall of Fame" displaying compasses recovered from the vicinity of major plasma events. Most of them point resolutely at "somewhere else," having given up on magnetic north as a lost cause.

‡ The official term is "preventing the operator from becoming one with the furnace" but academics prefer euphemism. The actual temperatures involved would cause most materials to petition for reclassification as plasma themselves.

‡‡ Professor Magnetwhistle's tenure was revoked shortly after this statement, though not for the heresy—the university had grown accustomed to his theoretical positions. Rather, he was asked to leave after his experimental verification destroyed the engineering building and created a localized gravitational anomaly that persists to this day.‡ Students are now advised to walk around Plot 7-B rather than through it, as shortcuts may result in arriving yesterday.

‡ The anomaly occasionally spits out objects that won't be lost for another three years. The Department of Temporal Affairs has stopped investigating, filing the entire situation under "Future-Past's Problem Now."

‡‡‡ The analogy originated with Practitioner Nimble-Fingers McGrath, who briefly achieved both before a spectacular accident that the medical texts refer to only as "The Incident of Unfortunate Verification." He survived, though his relationship with earthquakes has never fully recovered.

§ This is not hyperbole. The first three test operators reported symptoms of earthquake-related trauma for months afterward, despite the tests being conducted on geologically stable ground. The mind has difficulty processing some things, and "magnetic field that argues with itself" apparently ranks high on the list.

§§ The author has been asked to note that these temperatures are "only" comparable to the solar corona in the sense that both will kill you with similar enthusiasm. The plasma beam achieves slightly lower temperatures—around 10,000 degrees Kelvin—which is still hot enough to make most matter regret its life choices.

§§§ Plasma, being composed of highly energetic ionized particles, possesses what might charitably be called "an independent streak." Confining it has been compared to imprisoning lightning, herding cats made of fire, or convincing a dragon to stay in a chalk circle. The plasma doesn't actively want to escape so much as it simply refuses to acknowledge that containment was ever a viable option.

* The radius varies depending on beam intensity, atmospheric conditions, and what the technical literature calls "thaumic weather patterns." During high-magic conditions, the affected area can expand to twenty-five feet, at which point the operator is standing in what the Occupational Safety Guild classifies as "a poor choice."

** Continuous plasma projection appears in exactly three known historical accounts prior to the modern era. The first describes it as "the wrath of angry gods." The second calls it "the fire that does not cease." The third is a property survey noting that the land "remains somewhat molten" and should be avoide`,

  description: `DRAWING LINES THROUGH REALITY: HEAVY PARTICLE BEAMS

The development of sustained particle acceleration in beam form represents what the Archives of St. Brutus the Practically-Minded term "the point where theoretical physics became a municipal planning concern."* The fundamental principle—maintaining a coherent stream of accelerated particles over extended duration—sounds deceptively straightforward until one considers that the system requires power consumption equivalent to a mid-sized industrial city† and produces what Professor Hendricks of the Unseen University Department of Applied Devastation describes as "a line you can draw through literally anything, including common sense."‡

The energy requirements alone necessitate dedicated generation capacity, typically requiring a custom-built arcane reactor operating at no less than 847 megathaumaturgical units per second.** This places particle beam weaponry firmly in the category of "strategic assets requiring their own postal code,"†† as the infrastructure footprint rivals that of institutional facilities.‡‡ The Consortium of Responsible Thaumaturgical Engineering publishes quarterly reminders that particle beam installations should never share power grids with civilian populations, a guideline established after the Incident at Tallbridge*** which is still referred to in hushed tones as "the time the streetlights learned to cut through buildings."††† 

The penetrative capacity of sustained particle beams defies conventional understanding of material resistance, producing what combat engineers term "the anything problem"—namely, that the weapon penetrates anything.‡‡‡ Standard defensive architecture becomes decorative rather than functional**** when facing coherent particle streams operating at proper intensity. The Codex of Ancient Prohibitions, dating to the Second Age, contains warnings against "the light that carves the world,"***** suggesting our ancestors encountered similar principles, though presumably with less institutional oversight and more spectacular failures.†††††

The sustained damage output capacity positions particle beam weaponry as the definitive answer to the question "what if we needed something to stop existing continuously?"****** The mathematical models developed by Dame Katerina Flux demonstrate that properly configured systems can deliver destruction at rates measured not in discrete events but in "linear devastation per second,"******* a unit that made the Imperial Weights and Measures Commission deeply uncomfortable.‡‡‡‡ The beam's capacity to maintain coherence while traversing multiple obstacles means that the question is not whether the target will be destroyed, but rather what percentage of things between the weapon and the target will also cease to exist.********

The most famous historical validation of particle beam theory—and simultaneous argument against their casual deployment—remains the Unfortunate Tunnel Incident of 1847,†††††† when Colonel Marchmont's field test of a prototype system accidentally created what is now the Marchmont Passage, a perfectly cylindrical tunnel extending 3.7 kilometers through the Ironspine Mountains.‡‡‡‡‡ The tunnel remains in use today as a commercial thoroughfare, its walls exhibiting a suspicious glass-like smoothness that no conventional boring equipment could produce.********* The Colonel's official report, preserved in the Archives of Regrettable Innovation, contains the immortal phrase "the test was successful in all parameters except the ones involving controlled targeting and not creating permanent geographic features."********** Modern practitioners would do well to remember that particle beams draw very straight lines, and the universe rarely appreciates unsolicited geometric modification.*********

*The Archives of St. Brutus are housed in what was once a maximum security monastery, though whether they were keeping knowledge in or keeping practitioners out remains a matter of theological debate.

†Specifically, the power consumption of Ankh-Morpork between the hours of 6-7 PM on a cold winter's evening, when everyone has their heating spells running and the Watch is trying to operate its new administrative orb network. The calculation was performed by student actuary Mina Clearwater, who immediately changed career paths upon realizing what such weaponry implied about institutional priorities.

‡Professor Hendricks added, somewhat prophetically, "and I do mean *anything*." The transcript notes indicate he was looking meaningfully at the structural support beams of his lecture hall when he said this, causing considerable unease among the assembled students and the subsequent rescheduling of his entire course to ground-floor facilities.

**The megathaumaturgical unit, or MTU, represents the amount of arcane energy required to power a standard wizard's tower for one day, assuming the wizard in question maintains a reasonable definition of "necessary magical amenities."††† For reference, 847 MTU/second would power approximately 73,209,600 wizard towers for that same single day, assuming you could somehow compress that day into one second, which is probably what your particle beam is about to do to local spacetime anyway.

††This designation was formalized after the Department of Strategic Architecture realized that delivering mail to particle beam facilities required postal workers who had signed the Official Secrets Act and attended a three-day seminar on "recognizing the difference between a mailbox and a cooling vent that will vaporize you."

‡‡The typical particle beam installation occupies approximately 2.3 square kilometers, not including the mandatory "please stand here if you would like to continue existing" safety perimeter. For comparison, this is larger than 67% of recognized municipal governments in the Unnamed Territories, and better defended than 91% of them.

***The Incident at Tallbridge is documented in Appendix 47-G of the Consortium's Accident Reports, filed under "Catastrophic Success: Systems That Worked Too Well." The appendix runs to 847 pages, of which 723 are devoted to liability discussions and only 12 to the actual technical failure. The remaining pages are architectural drawings of the unintentional modifications made to Tallbridge's skyline.

†††Specifically, the streetlights didn't learn anything—they were simply connected to the same power grid that someone had decided could "probably handle" the additional load of a test firing. The resulting power surge caused the standard illumination crystals to exceed their design specifications by a factor of approximately 800,000%, producing light beams that cut through seventeen buildings before the failsafes finally activated. Tallbridge City Council now requires that all experimental weapons facilities maintain their own isolated power systems, a rule written in notably angry handwriting.

‡‡‡The technical specifications indicate that properly configured particle beams penetrate: steel (obviously), reinforced concrete (trivially), magically-hardened dwarf-steel (surprisingly easily, to the dwarfs' consternation), dragon scales (after brief fluorescence), the concept of "cover" (definitionally), peace of mind (immediately), and municipal zoning regulations (conclusively).

****The term "decorative" here is used in its most literal sense. After the demonstration at the Fortress of Unbreachable Walls†††††, architectural firms began marketing fortress features as "aesthetic heritage elements" rather than defensive structures, since everyone present had watched a single particle beam test shot create a hole through all seventeen layers of the fortress's legendary defensive walls, three hills behind the fortress, and ultimately a rather surprised merchant's cartload of cabbages six miles distant.

†††††The Fortress of Unbreachable Walls was renamed The Fortress of Thoroughly Breached Walls following the demonstration, then renamed again to The Fortress of Aesthetic Heritage Elements following consultation with marketing professionals who understood that some truths discourage tourism.

*****The Codex of Ancient Prohibitions is notable for being written in nine different ancient languages, none of which anyone can fully translate anymore. However, the pictograms accompanying this particular warning show a figure holding something that produces a straight line, followed by pictograms of mountains falling over, cities with new and unplanned skylights, and what appears to be a very angry dragon with a hole through it. The message, scholars agree, transcends linguistic barriers.

******This question was posed by General Thaddeus Ironwright during budget appropriations hearings, and the room fell so silent that the transcriptionist noted "twelve seconds of horrified contemplation" in the official record. The budget was approved unanimously, with the notation that half would go to development and half to "ensuring this thing is never pointed at anything we might regret later." It is worth noting that the definition of "things we might regret destroying" proved more difficult to codify than expected, eventually requiring a 2,400-page supplementary document.

*******Dame Katerina Flux's unit of "linear devastation per second" (LDS) measures the rate at which a particle beam renders a straight-line path through three-dimensional space into something more closely resembling a memory. The Imperial Weights and Measures Commission's discomfort was formally expressed in a letter noting that "proper units of measurement should not require trauma counselors for the people doing the measuring." Dame Flux's response, preserved in the Archives, consisted of detailed calculations demonstrating that her new unit was mathematically rigorous, followed by the handwritten notation "get over it."
