  description: `ON THE ENERGETIC PROPERTIES OF VITAL FLUIDS: BLOOD AS ARCANE FUEL

The discovery that blood contains exploitable magical energy represents one of those peculiar moments in arcane history where obvious theoretical foundations meet deeply uncomfortable practical applications*. The vital fluid that courses through living beings carries not merely oxygen and nutrients, but also what the ancient Mesopotamian mages termed "the fire of the small gods"†, a form of pure life-force that can be directly converted into magical energy with an efficiency that would make any modern thaumaturge weep with either joy or ethical discomfort, depending on their disposition‡.

The mechanism itself is remarkably straightforward: blood, being the primary medium through which life-force distributes itself throughout the body, maintains an average magical potential of approximately 3.7 thaums per milliliter**. A basic manifestation spell—what the common folk might call a "magic missile" and what the Guild of Nomenclature insists must be referred to as a "focused kinetic-arcane projection"††—requires roughly 40 milliliters of blood to power‡‡. This volume represents less than one percent of an average human's total blood supply, which initially led the pioneering researcher Magus Theodore Carruthers to declare the practice "perfectly sustainable" approximately forty-seven minutes before he fainted during a demonstration at the Royal Academy***. The critical issue, as subsequent research has repeatedly demonstrated†††, lies not in the volume but in the extraction methodology and the question of whose blood one intends to use‡‡‡.

The ethical considerations surrounding blood magic fall roughly into three categories, which the Crimson Council has thoughtfully ranked in order of "inadvisability"****. First, and least problematic, is the voluntary donation of one's own blood in carefully measured quantities—a practice that merely makes one lightheaded and perhaps slightly anemic if overdone. Second is the use of freely given blood from willing participants, which introduces complex questions of informed consent, market value of vital fluids, and the awkward social dynamics of asking friends if you can borrow a cup of their blood††††. Third, and most stringently prohibited by the International Convention on Acceptable Arcane Practices of 1847‡‡‡‡, is the non-consensual extraction of blood from others, a practice that transforms blood magic from a legitimate field of study into what is technically classified as both "assault" and "murder," depending on volume*****.

The relationship between the vitality of the source and the magical potency of the extracted blood proves remarkably linear, though the exact conversion factor varies by species, diet, and what one scholar memorably termed "general life satisfaction"†††††. Fresh blood maintains full potency for approximately seven minutes after extraction‡‡‡‡‡, after which the magical potential begins to decay at a rate of 12% per minute******, making blood banks and pre-drawn reserves largely impractical for combat situations. This temporal limitation has led to the unfortunate development of what historians now call "the live extraction problem"†††††††, though contemporary practitioners prefer the term "real-time energy harvesting" as it sounds considerably less like something that would get you imprisoned‡‡‡‡‡‡.

In conclusion, while blood magic represents a theoretically elegant solution to the perennial problem of arcane fuel sourcing, its practical applications remain constrained by biological, ethical, and legal considerations of considerable weight. Modern practitioners are strongly advised to limit themselves to self-donation in measured quantities, maintain detailed medical records, and under no circumstances attempt the techniques described in chapters four through seven of Blackwood's "Compendium of Efficient Extraction"*******, which is banned in forty-three countries for excellent reasons††††††††.

* The University of Brackenmoor maintains that this discovery was made independently by at least seventeen different civilizations, all of whom arrived at it through the time-honored scientific method of "someone got desperate and tried something stupid."

† Mesopotamian magical theory held that every living being contained thousands of tiny gods, each responsible for a different bodily function. The god responsible for toe-wiggling was apparently named Wigglibast. We have no evidence this is true, but no evidence it isn't.

‡ The Department of Ethical Thaumaturgy reports that 73% of their budget goes toward counseling mages who are having "feelings" about their research. The other 27% goes toward cleaning up after the ones who aren't.

** This measurement was standardized in 1823 by the Arcane Weights and Measures Commission, after the previous system—which measured magical potential in "sparkles per splash"—proved inadequate for serious academic work. The Commission's final report runs to 1,847 pages and includes a surprisingly heated debate about whether blood from vegetarians should be measured differently.

†† Guild members spent three years arguing about this nomenclature before settling on the current term, which nobody actually uses except in official documentation and grant proposals. The minutes from those meetings describe them as "spirited" and "occasionally requiring medical intervention."

††† Specifically, it has been demonstrated 847 times, with an average recovery time of 4.3 hours per demonstration and a total expenditure of 33,880 milliliters of smelling salts.

‡‡ This raises the obvious question: 40 milliliters from whom? The answer, as we shall see, is legally and morally significant.

‡‡‡ Carruthers recovered fully, though he was notably more cautious in subsequent demonstrations. He also pioneered the practice of having medical staff on standby, which is now standard at all blood magic conferences. The International Thaumaturgical Medical Association reports that their busiest season is the week after any major blood magic symposium.

**** This ranking system was developed after what the Council refers to only as "The Incident at St. Grimoire's" and what everyone else calls "the day the Ethics Committee all resigned simultaneously." Records from the period have been sealed for 100 years, though someone did leave a note reading "DO NOT RECREATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES" in red ink across the file cover.

†††† A survey by the Institute of Practical Sorcery found that 67% of blood mages reported that asking family members for blood donations "made Thanksgiving weird," while 23% noted it "made Thanksgiving impossible." The remaining 10% came from families of blood mages, where it was apparently considered normal.

‡‡‡‡ The Convention was convened after the so-called "Vampire Wars" of 1844-1846, which were neither fought by vampires nor technically wars, but did involve an unfortunate amount of unauthorized blood collection. The final treaty includes the memorable clause: "Cut it out. We mean it this time."

***** The distinction hinges on whether the subject survives. The Guild of Healers maintains very precise statistics on this, organized by extraction method, volume, and "general atmosphere of the proceedings." These statistics are not made public, though they do feature in several cautionary presentations titled "What Not to Do, Seriously, We Mean It."

††††† Professor Eliza Blackthorne of the Academy of Biothaumic Studies published a controversial paper suggesting that happiness increased blood potency by up to 15%. This led to a brief and ethically questionable period where some mages attempted to "cheer up" their subjects before extraction. The practice was banned after someone filed a complaint about being forced to watch puppies play before a scheduled blood draw, calling it "psychologically manipulative." The puppy-related regulations alone run to forty-seven pages.

‡‡‡‡‡ The exact mechanism of this decay remains mysterious, though prevailing theory suggests that the life-force "realizes" it's been separated from its source and begins to dissipate in what one researcher poetically called "existential resignation." This researcher was later asked to submit less anthropomorphic explanations to the Journal of Practical Blood Magic.

****** Interestingly, the decay rate appears to be influenced by temperature, ambient magical field strength, and—according to one disputed study—whether the blood is stored in glass or plastic containers. The glass-versus-plastic debate has created two distinct schools of thought in modern blood magic, who refuse to attend the same conferences.

††††††† The "live extraction problem" refers to the fact that maximum efficiency requires the blood to remain connected to a living source during casting, which introduces what ethicists call "substantial logistical and moral complications." The earliest known attempt to solve this problem dates to the Necromantic Conferences of 1456, where the proposed solution was so appalling that the conference was immediately disbanded and the venue was consecrated by three separate religious orders just to be safe†.

† The building in question is now a rather pleasant tea room, though patrons occasionally report that their Earl Grey tastes "vaguely cursed." Management insists this is just the bergamot.

  description: `# Measuring the Mana-Blood Conversion Ratio: A Quantitative Analysis

The establishment of standardized measurements in hemomancy* has proven considerably more challenging than in other magical disciplines, owing primarily to the tendency of experimental subjects to expire before completing the full battery of tests**. Nevertheless, through careful observation and the somewhat reluctant cooperation of the Royal College of Hemomantic Studies†, we have arrived at what might charitably be called "workable approximations" of the mana-blood conversion ratio.

The fundamental unit of measurement, established during the Treaty of Crimson Waters‡ in 1743, posits that one imperial pint of human blood yields approximately 47 mana points‡‡—though this figure represents an idealized average that assumes optimal extraction conditions, perfect health, and a blood alcohol content below 0.08%***. Individual variation proves substantial: a healthy practitioner with high magical aptitude may achieve ratios as favorable as 1:52†, while those suffering from anemia, magical exhaustion, or excessive consumption of pub food may see ratios plummet to 1:38 or lower††. The Guild of Practical Hemomancers maintains that accounting for these variations requires a sixteen-page questionnaire, three blood samples, and a small sacrifice to the actuarial gods‡‡‡.

The phenomenon of diminishing returns presents the most significant practical limitation to blood-based spellcasting. While the first pint extracted yields the promised 47 mana points, the second yields only approximately 39, the third a mere 28, and subsequent extractions follow an exponential decay that the mathematician Cornelius Bloodworth described as "disappointing in the extreme"§. This pattern, which Bloodworth termed the Cascade of Inadequacy, occurs because blood that remains in the body is not merely sitting idle§§—it is, rather regrettably, performing vital functions such as oxygenating tissue, transporting nutrients, and preventing one's immediate death§§§. The College has issued seventeen separate warnings about ignoring this principle, and maintains a small memorial garden for those who didn't listen****.

Most critically, practitioners must observe the death threshold††††, which represents the minimum blood volume required to sustain human life. The Imperial Academy of Hemomantic Medicine‡‡‡‡ has calculated this threshold with admirable precision: humans can safely lose up to 15% of total blood volume (approximately 1.2 pints for an average adult) without significant impairment, and up to 30% (2.4 pints) with medical supervision and a willingness to feel extremely unpleasant for several days§§§§. Beyond 40% blood loss, consciousness becomes optional; beyond 50%, so does continued existence*****. The Academy's official position is that "crossing the death threshold is inadvisable," a statement that ranks alongside "jumping off cliffs is not recommended for flight practice" in the annals of obvious institutional wisdom†††††.

Despite these limitations, efficient blood-casting remains the cornerstone of practical hemomancy‡‡‡‡‡, provided one maintains appropriate boundaries between "useful magic" and "accidentally committing suicide in pursuit of slightly better spell output"§§§§§. The measurement techniques described herein allow practitioners to maximize their mana extraction while maintaining the recommended ratio of "alive" to "dead" at approximately 1:0******.

## FOOTNOTES

*The word "hemomancy" derives from the ancient Khemic "hemo" (blood) and "mancy" (the art of doing inadvisable things with). Early texts suggest the practice originated when a wizard sneezed during a standard mana channeling exercise and, upon noticing the blood from his nosebleed had created interesting patterns on his spellbook, thought "I could use this." History does not record whether this wizard lived to regret his discovery, but the Archaeological Society of Suspicious Deaths has their suspicions.

**The University of Probably-Shouldn't-Have-Done-That maintains an entire wing dedicated to incomplete research projects. The Blood Measurement Archive occupies three floors, two of which are haunted by the ghosts of graduate students who took their experimental methodology too seriously. The third floor is haunted by their supervisors, who are even more upset.

†"Reluctant" here meaning "absolutely refused until the Royal Decree of Stop Being So Difficult" was issued in 1867. The College responded by cooperating but making the data as inconvenient to interpret as possible, a tradition that continues to this day.

‡The Treaty of Crimson Waters was signed aboard the HMS Decidedly Not A Good Idea while anchored in Lake Sanguine. Three nations participated: Albionshire, Vermillion, and the Democratic Republic of We're-Not-Quite-Sure-What-We're-Doing-But-We're-Committed-Now. The treaty established standardized measurements, prohibited the weaponization of blood pudding††, and mandated that all hemomantic research be conducted "with at least nominal regard for participant survival."

††The Blood Pudding Incident of 1741 remains classified, though leaked documents suggest it involved seventy-three casualties, two hundred witnesses who refuse to discuss it, and the complete evacuation of the town of Lesser Clotting. The official government position is that blood pudding was not, is not, and cannot be weaponized. Those who were there disagree, but quietly.

‡‡The number 47 was chosen not through rigorous experimentation but because it "sounded about right" according to Lord Pemberton Bloodletter, who conducted the measurements. Modern analysis suggests the actual figure is closer to 46.7, but changing the standard now would require updating forty years of textbooks, and nobody wants to deal with the Publishers' Guild††††††.

†††Sober practitioners. After three pints of ale, blood-to-mana efficiency actually decreases by approximately 22%, though practitioners report feeling "much more confident about it," which the College considers "part of the problem."

***This specification was added after the Great Tavern Incident of 1798‡‡‡‡‡‡, wherein a group of hemomancers attempted to demonstrate their art following a drinking competition. The results were recorded as "magically underwhelming, medically alarming, and socially catastrophic." Five people required hospitalization, two accidentally turned themselves invisible (poorly), and one briefly became a newt. He got better, but remained understandably bitter about it.

‡‡‡‡‡‡The Great Tavern Incident spawned the First Rule of Hemomancy: "Wine and blood magic don't mix." The Second Rule is "Yes, that includes beer." The Third Rule is "We're serious about the beer thing." The Fourth through Seventeenth Rules are variations on this theme, becoming increasingly exasperated in tone.

†The Guild of Practical Hemomancers, not to be confused with the Guild of Theoretical Hemomancers (who prefer discussing blood magic to actually using it) or the Guild of Formerly-Practical-But-Now-Cautious Hemomancers (formed after several members of the first guild experienced what they termed "revelatory near-death experiences").

††In extreme cases, practitioners have reported ratios as low as 1:12, typically accompanied by symptoms including dizziness, nausea, and questioning one's life choices. The College recommends "eating a proper breakfast" and "perhaps considering a different magical discipline entirely."

‡‡‡The actuarial gods are minor deities who emerged spontaneously from the collective anxiety of insurance assessors trying to calculate risk premiums for hemomantic practitioners. They are depicted as thin, nervous figures carrying enormous ledgers and muttering about "unacceptable risk factors." Their sacred day is Tuesday, which they chose because "nobody likes Tuesday anyway."

§Bloodworth's full quote reads: "The Cascade of Inadequacy represents not merely a quantitative diminishment but a qualitative tragedy, wherein the practitioner discovers that the universe has established hard limits on how much one can borrow from one's own cardiovascular system before said system files a formal complaint in the form of unconsciousness or death." He was not invited to many parties.

§§A fact that surprises approximately 60% of novice hemomancers, who seem to have conceptualized blood as "the red stuff that could probably be somewhere else if I needed it to be." The Medical Board has since mandated basic anatomy education, which has reduced but not eliminated this misconception.

§§§The body's resentment of blood extraction follows a predictable emotional trajectory: indifference (0-10% loss), annoyance (10-20%), formal protest (20-30%), active resistance (30-40%), and what the medical literature terms "complete organismal rebellion" (40%+). This last stage involves multiple organ systems simultaneously lodging complaints through the medium of systemic failure.

  description: `A SANGUINE STUDY: BLOOD TYPES AND THEIR MAGICAL PROPERTIES

The discovery that human blood may be categorized into distinct types—A, B, AB, and O—revolutionized both medicine and thaumaturgy in equal measure*. What began as Dr. Karl Landsteiner's entirely mundane observation in 1901† has, in the century since, fundamentally altered our understanding of why some practitioners achieve consistent magical results while others produce effects ranging from "disappointingly sparkly" to "oh gods, run."‡

The Type O practitioner represents approximately 45% of the magical population and serves as the baseline against which all other blood types are measured**. Their magical output demonstrates remarkable consistency—never spectacular, never catastrophic, but reliably present at a steady 87.3% of theoretical maximum††. Type O blood functions as a universal donor in both medical and magical contexts, though one should note that "universal" in thaumaturgical circles carries certain caveats that the International Sangromantic Council would prefer we not discuss in papers accessible to teenagers‡‡. Type A and Type B practitioners fall somewhere in the middle range, each with their particular quirks***—Type A showing enhanced precision in ritual work, Type B demonstrating marginally better raw power output but with a 12% higher chance of accidentally animating nearby furniture†††.

The true anomaly lies with Type AB blood, possessed by a mere 4% of the population and responsible for approximately 67% of all thaumaturgical incident reports filed with the Bureau of Magical Mishaps‡‡‡. Type AB practitioners achieve effects that range from the sublime to the utterly inexplicable****—one documented case involved a simple illumination spell that somehow produced not light but a color that several witnesses described as "somehow green and also the concept of Tuesday."†††† The volatility stems from the presence of both A and B antigens simultaneously, creating what noted sangromancer Dr. Millicent Bloodworth-Vane termed "aggressive magical indecision" in her seminal work *When Blood Types Collide: A History of Preventable Disasters*‡‡‡‡.

Perhaps no aspect of blood magic has generated more persistent mythology than the notion of so-called "royal blood" possessing inherently superior magical properties*****. This belief persists despite approximately four hundred years of empirical evidence to the contrary†††††, leading to an entire sub-field of genealogical thaumaturgy devoted to explaining why the magical abilities of crowned heads are statistically identical to those of the general population‡‡‡‡‡. The truth, as is so often the case, proves disappointingly democratic: magical aptitude correlates with blood type, training, and natural talent, with precisely zero measurable contribution from the number of "von"s in one's surname******. The Royal Academy of Sanguimancy maintains a locked archive of particularly embarrassing royal spell failures, access to which requires both security clearance and a strong stomach†††††††.

The catastrophic incompatibility of mixed blood types in ritual work represents perhaps the most critical safety consideration in modern thaumaturgy*******. When blood of different types combines in a magical circle, the resulting interaction produces what the Bureau's official documentation euphemistically terms "energetic disambiguation"—a phrase that rather undersells the reality of explosions, spatial rifts, and in one memorable incident, the spontaneous generation of extremely confused butterflies‡‡‡‡‡‡. The Sanguine Incompatibility Theorem, proven conclusively by Professor Heinrich Blutmann in 1847 and again in 1848 after the faculty demanded experimental verification‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, demonstrates mathematically why mixing Type A and Type B blood in equal proportions creates a thaumaturgical reaction approximately 847 times more violent than either type would produce independently********. Modern safety protocols now mandate blood type verification before any collaborative ritual work, a requirement instituted after the Incident at Canterbury College†††††††† which we are still technically not supposed to discuss in detail‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.


FOOTNOTES:

*Though the medical profession tends to take credit for this discovery, the Hermetic Order of the Crimson Vein had been sorting practitioners by "sanguine humor" since at least 1632, albeit with a classification system that included such categories as "choleric-phlegmatic with afternoon tendencies" and "definitely something but we're not sure what." Their records, while magically sound, were considered too confusing to present at medical conferences.

†Dr. Landsteiner received the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work. The citation makes no mention of the fact that his laboratory assistant was a practicing hedge witch who had been trying to tell him about blood type interactions for three years. She did not receive a Nobel Prize. She did, however, successfully curse his commemorative statue to always look slightly disappointed.

‡The official classification system established by the International Sangromantic Council in 1952 includes a Level 6 result category defined simply as "please evacuate the building in an orderly fashion." Level 7 removes the word "orderly."

**The percentage would be higher, but Type O practitioners have a documented tendency toward what the literature terms "adequate but uninspired" spellwork. One prominent Type O mage, when asked to comment, simply shrugged and said the spell had worked, hadn't it? What more did people want?

††This figure was calculated by the Department of Thaumaturgical Statistics after reviewing 847,392 controlled spell castings over a fifteen-year period. The Department requested funding to achieve a sample size of one million castings but was denied on grounds that everyone was "quite tired of being asked to cast the same illumination spell over and over again for science."

‡‡Specifically, they would prefer we not mention the Donor Compatibility Incident of 1967, wherein a well-meaning Type O practitioner attempted to "donate" magical energy to a Type A colleague during a complex ritual. The resulting cascade effect transformed the entire third floor of the Council headquarters into what can only be described as "inside-out." It took three months and a team of spatial geometrists to fix, and the third-floor bathroom still occasionally leads to the basement.

***The word "quirk" here is doing quite a lot of heavy lifting. The actual technical literature uses terms like "significant deviation from baseline thaumaturgical response" and "pronounced tendency toward lateral effect manifestation," but these lack a certain accessibility for the general readership.

†††The animation effect appears to be entirely random. One Type B practitioner in Oslo reported that over the course of her career, she had inadvertently animated: four chairs, seven tables, a bookshelf that became deeply philosophical about its purpose, and a hat stand that developed strong political opinions. She eventually sold the hat stand to a collector in Prague.

‡‡‡The Bureau's annual report for 1923 noted that Type AB practitioners represented 4.1% of registered mages but 67.3% of filed incident reports, 89% of "unusual outcome" notifications, and somehow 3% of incident reports filed the year *before* the practitioner registered. The Bureau has declined to explain this last statistic, citing "temporal complications" and "too much paperwork."

****Dr. Artemisia Blackwood, herself a Type AB practitioner, described her own blood type as possessing "an unfortunate enthusiasm for the untested." Her doctoral thesis defense famously resulted in the spontaneous manifestation of a small but vocal choir of crystalline entities that sang the theoretical implications of her work in perfect four-part harmony. She passed with distinction.

††††The Committee for Chromatic Classification spent three weeks debating whether to add "Tuesday" as an official color category. They ultimately declined, but not before seventeen members reported dreams about the color of weekdays. Six of those members were Type AB. Draw your own conclusions.

‡‡‡‡Dr. Bloodworth-Vane's work remains the definitive text on blood type interactions, though readers should be aware that her research methodology included what she termed "aggressive empiricism"—a polite term for "trying things and seeing what exploded." She survived her research career largely through possessing Type O blood herself and maintaining a safe distance from her more volatile subjects. She also maintained excellent insurance.

*****The persistence of this myth can be traced to a single sentence in *Monarchical Mysteries* by Lord Pemberton Smythe-Forsythe III, who wrote in 1743 that "the blood of kings flows with peculiar potency." What most readers fail to note is that this sentence appears in a chapter explicitly marked "Discredited Theories and Absolute Nonsense." Reading comprehension, it seems, is not universal among the nobility.

  description: `THE CONSENT PARADOX: VOLUNTARY BLOOD AND MAGICAL POTENCY

The fundamental misconception plaguing blood magic for approximately four thousand years* can be summarized thusly: practitioners believe that the more unwilling the donor, the more potent the resulting magical energy. This is, to put it in the technical terminology preferred by the Consortium of Ethical Thaumaturgy, "complete bollocks"**. The truth, as demonstrated by no fewer than seventy-three peer-reviewed studies† and one rather awkward incident at the Ankh-Morpork College of Practical Magic††, is precisely the inverse: voluntary blood donation produces magical energy outputs between 200-300% more stable and potent than forced extraction†††.

The psychological component of blood magic operates according to principles that should surprise absolutely no one who has ever tried to get a cat into a carrier‡. When blood is freely given—that is, donated with full informed consent, proper paperwork‡‡, and ideally a biscuit afterwards‡‡‡—the thaumic resonance remains coherent at the quantum level§. The donor's intention, their willingness to participate in the magical working, becomes embedded in the blood's thaumic signature at approximately 47.3 angstroms§§, creating what Professor Hershel Blodstein of the Unseen University termed "sympathetic coherence"§§§. Conversely, when blood is taken by force—through coercion, torture, or what the Guild of Accountants classifies as "Non-Consensual Hemomantic Acquisition"*—the resulting magical signature becomes chaotic, unstable, and prone to what technical literature euphemistically calls "energetic reversal events"**.

This brings us to the rather awkward topic of why torture, despite its persistent popularity among a certain type of practitioner††, does not improve magical yield. The data here is unambiguous†††, though it took the magical community an embarrassingly long time to accept it‡‡‡. The stress hormones released during torture—primarily cortisol and adrenaline—actively interfere with thaumic resonance at the molecular level§, creating what amounts to magical static§§. The International Institute of Hemomantic Ethics has documented this phenomenon in excruciating detail§§§, including full spectrographic analysis of the resulting chaos patterns*. One particularly memorable study compared outputs from voluntary donors at the Genua Blood Cooperative** versus the now-defunct Blood Pits of Klatch***, finding that the cooperative's magic was not only 273% more potent but also, and this is a direct quote from the report, "significantly less likely to explode or summon things with too many teeth"†.

Historical examination reveals a clear pattern: blood cults, with their dramatic midnight rituals and unwilling victims, consistently produced inferior magical results compared to blood cooperatives, which operated rather like a combination of a blood bank and a workers' collective††. The Crimson Sisterhood of Ephebe‡, functioning from approximately 450 BCE to 127 CE‡‡, maintained detailed records showing that their voluntary donation circles generated stable magical energy sufficient to power the city's street lighting for three centuries‡‡‡. Compare this to the Blood Cults of Ur-Gilash§, whose forced extraction methods produced impressive theatrical effects but rarely lasted longer than a fortnight before "catastrophic thaumic cascade failure"§§—which is bureaucratic language for "everyone involved got turned inside out"§§§. The lesson, had anyone been listening*, was clear: consent is not merely an ethical consideration but a fundamental requirement for stable blood magic**.


---FOOTNOTES---

*According to the Archives of Thaumic Mistakes, which take up fully seventeen floors of the Library of the Unseen University. The Librarian has been heard to "ook" disapprovingly when anyone requests access to the section on blood magic, which, given his generally cheerful disposition, suggests these are mistakes worth learning from. Or, more accurately, mistakes worth learning never to repeat.

**This exact phrasing appears in the Consortium's 1873 position paper, "On the Fundamental Stupidity of Common Practice in Hemomantic Arts." The paper's author, Magister Helena Bloodworth (no relation to the vampiric Bloodworths of Uberwald†, she was very insistent about this), won the Pratchett Prize for Academic Candor that year.

†These studies span cultures from the Agatean Empire to the Sto Plains, with remarkably consistent results. The methodology involved careful measurement of thaumic output, control groups, and what the Ethics Committee described as "an uncomfortable amount of paperwork."

††The incident involved a visiting lecturer from Pseudopolis, three first-year students, and a summoning circle that was supposed to be purely theoretical. The resulting entity, while not strictly dangerous, did express extremely firm opinions about informed consent. It spent six hours lecturing the assembled students before dissipating. The transcript runs to 247 pages and is mandatory reading for all hemomantic students.

†††This percentage varies slightly depending on the donor's hydration level, whether they've had breakfast, and their general feelings about the practitioner. One study found that donors who actively liked the practitioner produced energy outputs up to 347% more stable, leading to the now-common practice of practitioners offering tea and biscuits before requesting donations.

‡This comparison is from Professor Nefertiti Bloodroot's seminal work, "Feline Cooperation Studies and Their Application to Hemomantic Practice" (Ankh-Morpork University Press, 1834). She noted that both cats and blood donors become significantly less cooperative when manhandled, and attempting to force either results in what she termed "enthusiastic non-cooperation with extreme prejudice."

‡‡The paperwork requirements were standardized by the Guild of Lawyers in 1847, following what is known in legal circles as "The Regrettable Incident at Quirm." The forms now run to fourteen pages and include such clauses as "I understand that my blood may be used for magical purposes including but not limited to: scrying, binding, power generation, ritual circles, and definitely not summoning anything with tentacles."

‡‡‡The biscuit is not technically required by Guild regulations, but the correlation between biscuit provision and magical stability is undeniable. Custard creams produce the most stable results, followed by digestives. Rich tea biscuits produce acceptable but unremarkable outcomes. The data on this fills three volumes at the Institute of Culinary Thaumaturgy.

§Quantum coherence in blood magic operates according to principles that make quantum physicists uncomfortable and wizards uncomfortable in different but equally valid ways. The fact that observation affects the outcome, but so does the donor's emotional state, which is itself a form of observation, creates what Professor Uncertainty of the Unseen University calls "a right bloody headache."

§§This measurement, taken by the Ankh-Morpork Institute of Precision Thaumaturgy using equipment calibrated to within 0.000003 angstroms, represents hundreds of hours of careful experimentation. The lead researcher, Dr. Sanguine Measures, noted in her lab journal: "It's always 47.3. ALWAYS. Even when we deliberately miscalibrate the equipment. The blood knows. How does the blood know???"

§§§Blodstein's paper, "Sympathetic Coherence in Voluntary Hemomantic Donation" (Journal of Ethical Blood Magic, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1891), revolutionized the field despite his unfortunate surname making every presentation somewhat awkward.

  description: `TEMPORAL DEGRADATION OF SANGUINE MANA: A STUDY IN BLOOD STORAGE

The preservation of blood for hemomantic purposes presents unique challenges not encountered in traditional thaumaturgic storage* protocols. Unlike crystallized mana or bound essences, which maintain their potency indefinitely when properly contained†, blood represents a living medium whose magical properties degrade in direct proportion to its biological viability. At standard room temperature (approximately 20°C), fresh blood loses roughly 10% of its mana-binding capacity per hour‡, a rate of deterioration that the Royal College of Applied Hemomancy has termed "catastrophically inconvenient"§. This degradation occurs regardless of the donor's magical potency** or species††, suggesting that the decay mechanism operates at a fundamental level of thaumaturgic physics rather than being a property of the blood itself‡‡.

Conventional refrigeration extends the practical usability window to approximately seventy-two hours§§, though this figure varies significantly based on containment vessel composition*** and local thaumic field strength†††. The mechanism by which cold temperatures preserve mana-binding capacity remains poorly understood‡‡‡, though Professor Hieronymus Blackthorne of the University of Ankh-Morpork§§§ theorizes it relates to reduced molecular motion allowing crystalline mana structures to remain coherent**** within the hemoglobin matrix††††. However, attempts to further extend preservation through freezing have universally failed‡‡‡‡, as ice crystal formation disrupts the delicate mana-bonding sites§§§§ with what one researcher described as "enthusiastic thoroughness"*****.

The most reliable long-term preservation method involves the dual application of alchemical salt†††††  and silver particulate‡‡‡‡‡ in precise ratios§§§§§. This technique, rediscovered by the Sisters of the Sanguine Covenant in 1847******, enables storage for up to six lunar months without significant degradation††††††, though the process requires considerable expertise‡‡‡‡‡‡ and remains unsuitable for field applications§§§§§§. The salt acts as a mana-stabilizing matrix*******, while the silver prevents mundane bacterial degradation†††††††  and certain forms of spiritual contamination‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ that would otherwise compromise both the biological and thaumaturgic properties of the stored material§§§§§§§.

Contemporary blood banking facilities******** employ a combination of these techniques, utilizing refrigerated storage for short-term needs†††††††† and salt-silver preservation for strategic reserves‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. The Continental Institute for Hemomantic Studies maintains that properly preserved blood retains 94-97% of its original potency§§§§§§§§, though several independent audits********* have suggested these figures may be optimistic by approximately 3-7%††††††††† depending on storage conditions‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡. Regardless of minor statistical disputes, the development of reliable blood preservation protocols has revolutionized hemomantic practice§§§§§§§§§, eliminating the previous requirement for "fresh donors"**********, a term that the ethics committees are still trying to fully unpack†††††††††††.

*The Standard Thaumaturgic Storage Protocol, published in its 47th revised edition by the International Guild of Applied Magics, runs to approximately 3,400 pages and includes detailed diagrams of 127 different containment vessel types. The section on "What Not To Store In Your Kitchen" alone comprises 89 pages, all of them based on documented incidents.

†This is a lie. All magical substances degrade eventually, but crystals do it slowly enough that nobody notices within a human lifetime, which for bureaucratic purposes counts as "indefinitely."

‡The discovery of this degradation rate came about through the unfortunate experiments of Dr. Malachi Grimshaw, who spent three weeks measuring the mana content of increasingly stale blood samples before realizing he could have simply asked any competent vampire. They've known about this for centuries but considered it "obvious."

§The full quote from the College's official report reads: "catastrophically inconvenient, monumentally impractical, and thoroughly vexing." The report's author was reportedly having a bad week.

**Though donors with higher baseline potency do provide proportionally more useful material even after degradation. A powerful wizard's 24-hour-old blood remains more potent than a common peasant's fresh sample, a fact that has created its own set of ethical complications†.

†The Market Rate Donor Compensation Scandal of 1923 involved seventeen noble families, forty-three banking institutions, and one particularly entrepreneurial vampire‡ who ran what was technically a legitimate business but felt deeply wrong to everyone involved.

‡Griselda von Blutstein, who maintained that she was providing a valuable service and that the nobility were willing participants. The courts agreed, though they did ban her from operating within city limits. She now runs a thriving export business from a castle in the mountains.

††Including several non-human species whose blood proves equally useful for hemomantic purposes. The Dwarf-Blood Storage Protocols‡ differ only slightly from human standards, primarily in vessel size recommendations.

‡Dwarfs, it must be noted, take a remarkably pragmatic view of blood donation, treating it much like any other tradeable commodity. The Dwarfish phrase "blood and gold" is used to describe things of fundamental value, and they see no contradiction in this.

‡‡The leading theory suggests that mana bonds to hemoglobin through quantum thaumic resonance§, which sounds impressive but is actually just a fancy way of saying "we've observed it happens but have no idea why."

§Quantum thaumic resonance was named by Professor Edmund Blackstaff, who admitted in his private journals that he chose the term specifically because it "sounds sufficiently complex that people stop asking questions." This strategy has proven remarkably successful.

§§This 72-hour figure comes from extensive testing at the Continental Institute's Blood Research Division**, where they maintain 487 samples at various stages of degradation for ongoing study. Visiting researchers report the entire wing smells faintly of iron and disappointment.

**The Division occupies the entire fourth floor of the Institute's eastern wing and employs 23 full-time researchers, 14 preservation specialists, and one extremely overworked janitor who has requested hazard pay on seventeen separate occasions. He has received it precisely zero times.

***Glass vessels prove superior to ceramic, which prove superior to metal††, which prove vastly superior to wood‡‡ or leather§§. The rankings were determined through exhaustive testing and several small fires.

††Except silver, which enhances preservation but is prohibitively expensive for common storage use.

‡‡The Great Wooden Cask Incident of 1889 at the Pragueish Academy resulted in seven casualties, thirty-two injuries, and the complete evacuation of the northeastern campus. The university now forbids wooden containers in any hemomantic laboratory, a rule enforced with surprising vigor.

§§Leather proved so catastrophically unsuitable that experiments were discontinued after the first three trials. The surviving documentation simply notes "DO NOT" in letters three inches tall, underlined multiple times.

†††Areas with high ambient magical fields show accelerated degradation***, while thaumic dead zones†† somewhat extend preservation time. This creates interesting logistical challenges for blood banks‡‡.

***The Blood Bank of Greater Ankh-Morpork, situated unfortunate proximity to the University's High Energy Magic building, experiences approximately 18% faster degradation than the theoretical baseline. They have filed numerous complaints. The University has ignored all of them.

††Such as the infamous Dead Marshes of Lower Scraddia, where magical energies go to die. The region would be ideal for blood storage if it weren't for the mosquitoes, the smell, and the fact that nobody wants to live there.

‡‡The Thaumic Geography Society publishes annual maps of optimal storage locations. These maps are largely ignored because optimal storage locations are rarely anywhere convenient, like major cities or near actual people.

‡‡‡Professor Blackthorne's full theory spans 340 pages and includes seventeen equations that most mathematicians consider "unnecessarily dramatic." His colleagues suggest he could have conveyed the same information in perhaps twenty pages, but he enjoys the drama§§.

§§Blackthorne is known for his theatrical lectures, during which he wears a cape§ and gestures dramatically. Students attend his classes in unusually high numbers, though some report learning more about showmanship than hemomancy.

§His cape is purple velvet with silver embroidery depicting the molecular structure`,
