  description: `# Conjuring the Waters: Creating Water from Magical Energy

**By Archmage Hydrus Wellspring, University of Perpetual Springs**
**Published in the Journal of Elementary Transmutation, Vol. 423, Issue 7**

---

The fundamental transmutation of magical energy into potable water represents one of the oldest and most reliable spells in the practitioner's arsenal*, though its apparent simplicity belies a fascinating complexity in its molecular restructuring**. At its core, the spell requires the caster to channel raw mana through specific mental constructs that reshape reality at the atomic level, forcing hydrogen and oxygen to combine in the precise 2:1 ratio nature herself prefers†. The resulting water materializes at approximately room temperature††—a detail that has spawned considerable theological debate regarding what "room temperature" means in cosmically absolute terms†††—and possesses a purity that would make natural springs weep with envy‡.

The question of why magically conjured water proves purer than its naturally occurring counterpart has occupied scholars for millennia‡‡. Professor Aquilia Clearbrook of the Institute for Liquid Studies demonstrated that mana, when properly directed, has no interest whatsoever in creating anything except exactly what you've asked for‡‡‡—a refreshing change from natural processes, which tend to throw in minerals, microorganisms, and the occasional confused fish§. This molecular precision means that conjured water contains precisely two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom per molecule, with absolutely nothing else§§, making it technically the purest substance most practitioners will ever handle§§§. The water arrives, as it were, fresh from the void, untouched by limestone, innocent of dissolved salts, and blissfully ignorant of having ever been through a dinosaur*.

Volume limitations present the primary constraint for novice practitioners**. The relationship between available mana and producible water follows what scholars call the Dampening Curve†*, which suggests that a beginning mage might conjure anywhere from a cup to a small bucket of water before exhausting their reserves††*. Advanced practitioners can, of course, produce considerably more‡*, though the record remains held by Archmage Torrent the Excessive, who produced enough water to fill a modest lake before collapsing from exhaustion and having to be carried home in a bucket‡‡*. The spell's efficiency improves dramatically with practice§*, and most competent practitioners can eventually conjure sufficient water for daily needs without significantly depleting their magical reserves§§*.

One must note certain practical considerations that the ancient texts, in their infinite wisdom, somehow neglected to mention§§§*. The water appears exactly where you direct it to appear—not approximately where you wanted it, not near the general vicinity, but precisely at the designated coordinates*. This precision proves either a blessing or a curse depending on your spatial awareness**. Additionally, while the water materializes at room temperature, defining which room's temperature remains a matter of some interpretive flexibility among the Elements themselves††. Desert practitioners report noticeably warmer conjured water than their tundra-dwelling colleagues‡‡, leading to the establishment of the International Conjured Water Temperature Standards Board†††, which meets biannually and has yet to reach a consensus on anything except the quality of the lunch service‡‡‡.

*The spell predates written history by a considerable margin, though oral traditions suggest it was invented approximately three hours after the invention of thirst. The Singing Stones of Mesopotamia allegedly contain a version of the incantation, though they stopped singing in 1847 after what historians describe as "an incident with an overeager archaeologist and a tuning fork."

**Not to be confused with molecular deconstruction, which is significantly messier and explains why we no longer invite Archmage Splatter to academic conferences.

†Nature, as it turns out, is quite particular about her ratios. Attempts to create water with a 3:1 hydrogen-oxygen ratio resulted in what the Guild of Experimental Transmutation referred to as "The Thursday We Don't Talk About." The laboratory has since been rebuilt, though the scorch marks lend it a certain character.

††Approximately 20°C or 68°F, though see footnote ††† for why this is more complicated than it sounds.

†††The debate centers on whether "room temperature" refers to (a) the temperature of the room where the spell was cast, (b) the temperature of an idealized Platonic room existing in perfect universal harmony, or (c) the temperature of the room where the water appears, which might be an entirely different room altogether. The Theological Faculty at the University of Perpetual Springs has been arguing about this since 1673. They have produced 47 volumes of commentary and no conclusions.

‡Young practitioners are cautioned not to let this power go to their heads. The formation of the Society for Natural Water Appreciation followed several regrettable incidents of conjurers publicly disparaging regular springs, one of which involved an ancient river god who turned out to be less mythological than anticipated†.

†The god in question, Old Meander, was reportedly "quite put out" and required three formal apologies, a tributary offering, and the resignation of the offending mage before he would stop flooding the academy's basement every Tuesday.

‡‡Mostly by scholars who had significantly more time on their hands than problems to solve. The complete bibliography of works on conjured water purity would itself require conjured water to produce enough paper pulp for printing.

‡‡‡This represents a stark contrast to natural water formation, which involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, geological filtration, and what one might charitably call "life's general enthusiasm for mixing things together." Nature is a wonderful recycler but a terrible perfectionist.

§The Incident of the Spontaneous Trout (1823) proved exceptionally difficult to explain to the Academy's board of inquiry. The conjurer insisted she had been thinking only of water. The trout, which appeared fully formed and quite surprised in the middle of her washing basin, suggested otherwise. Both parties declined to comment further††.

††The trout was eventually rehomed to a decorative pond where it lived out its days in comfort, though it reportedly never trusted Tuesdays again.

§§With the notable exception of whatever you were thinking about at the time. Mental discipline proves essential. Those who let their minds wander while conjuring have reported finding their water contaminated with memories of breakfast, fragments of grocery lists, and in one documented case, the complete lyrics to a tavern song the caster thought they'd forgotten‡††.

‡††The song was "The Barmaid's Regrettable Evening," which contains seventeen verses of escalating absurdity. The water allegedly tasted faintly of poor decisions and wheat beer.

§§§Magically conjured water contains zero minerals, which sounds healthy until one realizes that humans require certain minerals for survival. The Guild of Nutritional Thaumaturgy recommends supplementing a diet of purely conjured water with actual food, advice they felt necessary to formalize after The Unfortunate Experiment of 1756§*.

§*In which a well-meaning but misguided health enthusiast attempted to survive on nothing but conjured water and positive thinking. The experiment lasted nine days before his colleagues staged an intervention involving a roast chicken and some very firm words about human biology.

*Dinosaurs drank a lot of water during their lengthy tenure on this planet. Statistically speaking, every glass of natural water you've ever consumed has probably been through at least one dinosaur, three fish, and a moderate-sized fern. Conjured water, being fresh from the aetheric realm, has never been through anything except your rather specific magical intentions**.

**Though given some practitioners' intentions, this might not actually be better. The Standards of Mental Hygiene While Conjuring (SMHWC) exists for excellent reasons, most of which are classified.

**The Dampening Curve, first described by Professor Sogsworth in his seminal work "On the Relationship Between Magical Reserves and Liquid Volume," demonstrates that water production follows a roughly linear relationship until the practitioner's mana drops below 30%, at which point efficiency falls off dramatically. Below 10% mana, attempting to conjure water typically produces only a disappointing damp spot and a headache††*.

††*The Mage's Headache, a well-documented phenomenon, feels precisely like someone has replaced your brain with a soggy sponge that's being rhythmically squeezed. It passes in about twenty minutes but serves as an excellent teacher of restraint.

†*So named because excessive use tends to dampen one's enthusiasm for showing off. The curve was originally called the Sogsworth-Dampening Correlation, but everyone agreed this was redundant given that Professor Sogsworth was himself quite damp by the time he'd finished his research.

  description: `# Liquid Sculpture: Controlling and Shaping Water

The manipulation of water beyond its conventional existence—that is, beyond the tiresome confines of flowing downward and pooling in the lowest available depression—represents one of the fundamental achievements of practical hydromancy*. Unlike the relatively straightforward conjuration of water from ambient humidity or the elemental plane†, the actual shaping of liquid into sustained non-gravitational configurations requires the practitioner to maintain constant metaphysical pressure against two of nature's most stubborn principles: gravity and surface tension‡. The successful water-shaper must essentially convince several pounds of liquid that it would much prefer to remain suspended in mid-air as a sphere, or arranged vertically as a wall, rather than obeying approximately 13.8 billion years of physical law**. This requires not insignificant hubris, though considerably less than is needed for human flight, and substantially more than is needed for simple levitation of solid objects††.

The progression from simple water manipulation to complex liquid architecture follows a well-documented gradient of increasing mental strain‡‡. Beginning practitioners typically start with spheres*, which require only that one maintain the concept of "ball of water that stays ball-shaped" in one's consciousness—a task that the Institute of Aqueous Studies rates at approximately 3.2 merlins† of sustained concentration**. From there, students advance to walls‡‡, sheets‡‡‡, and eventually to more complex geometric forms§, though the Academy strongly recommends against attempting water sculpture of one's own face until after at least seven months of practice§§. The creation of water-based weapons—spears, whips, or the popular graduated series of increasingly sharp discs§§§—demands not only the maintenance of form but the addition of directional momentum and, in some cases, the metaphysical concept of "sharpness" to a substance that is definitionally not sharp*.

What distinguishes water-shaping from mere telekinesis applied to liquids† is the requirement for continuous active concentration rather than the establishment of a persistent enchantment. The moment the practitioner's attention wavers—whether due to distraction, sneezing, sudden loud noises, or the unexpected appearance of one's ex-partner at a social gathering‡—the water immediately reverts to its natural state with what witnesses invariably describe as "unseemly enthusiasm" and "more splash damage than anticipated"§. This characteristic has led to the development of various mnemonic techniques and concentration exercises**, among them the Perpetual Awareness Method of the Submerged Monks of Lake Hali††, the controversial Synchronized Breathing Pattern of Professor Undine‡‡, and the remarkably effective but legally questionable practice of having a small child repeatedly shout "Don't drop it!" throughout the shaping process§§.

The practical applications of water-shaping extend far beyond mere demonstration of one's ability to make physics uncomfortable§§§. Military historians note that aqueous walls have defended seventeen major cities from invasion*, while water-based weapons feature prominently in approximately forty-two percent of all documented hydromancer duels† (the remainder involving either ice, steam, or undignified amounts of splashing)‡. More peaceful applications include decorative fountains that require no plumbing**, mobile irrigation systems for desert agriculture††, and the annual Water Sculpture Competition of Aquos‡‡, which has been running continuously for three centuries except for a fifteen-year interruption following the Incident of 1847§§. The Society for Hydromantic Research continues to explore the theoretical limits of liquid manipulation, though their current record-holder—a sustained water sculpture of the entire Council of Mages, at 1:3 scale, maintained for seven hours—required six practitioners working in shifts and resulted in three cases of severe mental fatigue and one profound existential crisis§§§§.

*The term "hydromancy" technically refers to divination by water, but language is a democracy and the water-manipulation community has voted with their usage. The divination people can have "aquascience" or "liquidology" if they want something back. They have not responded to this generous offer, probably because they saw this conflict coming in their water bowls.

‡Surface tension, that peculiar quality that allows water striders to walk on water and prevents you from drinking your beverage without it forming an annoying droplet on the rim, operates at approximately 72 millinewtons per meter at room temperature. The amount of magical force required to overcome it entirely is, according to the Revised Tables of Hydromantic Pressure, "rather a lot, actually."

**The universe has been insisting on objects falling downward for quite some time. It takes this position rather personally when you suggest alternatives. The fact that birds manage this doesn't help your case; the universe has made an exception for birds and is not accepting new applications.

††The Levitation Controversy of 1823 established that lifting a brick is approximately 67% easier than lifting an equivalent weight of water, because the brick has the decency to stay brick-shaped when you're not looking at it.

‡‡One merlin equals the amount of concentration required to keep a single clear image of a purple elephant in your mind for sixty seconds. It is named after Merlin the Distracted, who famously could not. The unit has since been standardized by the International Bureau of Mystical Measurements, located in a building in Geneva that nobody can ever quite remember the location of†.

†The building is actually in Lausanne. The Geneva thing is a persistent administrative error that has continued for forty-seven years because fixing it would require admitting the error, and the Bureau's charter forbids acknowledgment of mistakes made more than thirty years ago. This has created some interesting legal situations.

‡‡‡Beginning students often ask why they can't simply freeze the water into the desired shape and then maintain it as ice. This is an excellent question that demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the curriculum. We're teaching water-shaping, not ice-sculpting. That's next semester. Also, ice-sculptors are insufferably smug about their creations "lasting" and "not requiring constant attention."

§The Municipal Water-Shaping Academy maintains a Hall of Cautionary Examples featuring photographs of seventeen attempts at facial self-portraiture, all of which resolved into expressions of profound existential dread about three minutes into the shaping process. As Master Aquifer noted in his seminal text "Faces and Fluids: A Meditation on Failure," the human subconscious apparently cannot maintain an objective view of its own features, leading to water-faces that gradually morph into "what you fear you look like after a bad night's sleep."

§§The seven-month recommendation comes from statistical analysis of 3,847 students, of whom 2,331 attempted their own face before the recommended period. Of these, 2,329 gave up in frustration, one succeeded in creating a water sculpture that looked exactly like them, and one accidentally created a water sculpture that looked exactly like Professor Undine, leading to an awkward three-week period where they were prohibited from attending hydromancy lectures.

§§§The Graduated Disc Progression was invented by Magus Thalassa the Precise, who believed that water-weapons should be approached with the same methodical care as one approaches actual weaponry. Her twelve-volume treatise "From Circle to Chakram: A Journey Through Liquid Lethality" remains the definitive work on the subject, despite being banned in seven kingdoms for its enthusiastic descriptions of exactly how much damage a well-thrown water disc can accomplish†. The ban has, predictably, made it tremendously popular.

†Volume Seven, "On the Bisection of Melons and Other Fruits," is particularly graphic. Volume Nine, "Theoretical Applications Against Harder Targets," was deemed unsuitable for general circulation after the Peacekeepers' Guild lodged a formal complaint about its detailed diagrams.

*This is, of course, a simplification. Water can be sharp if moving fast enough, as anyone who has experienced a pressure washer or stood beneath a waterfall will attest. What the practitioner is actually imbuing is the concept of "sharp along this edge specifically" combined with "maintains this sharpness while moving through air" and "doesn't just splash on impact like water normally does." Magic is largely about having very specific arguments with reality.

†The distinction is documented exhaustively in Professor Undine's controversial paper "It's Not Telekinesis If You're Asking Nicely: Quantum Consciousness and Liquid Sympathy," which proposed that water has a form of collective consciousness that can be negotiated with, rather than simply pushed around. The paper was rejected by four major journals before being published in "Aquatic Philosophy Quarterly," which has a reputation for printing literally`,

  description: `# Freezing Point Depression: Instant Ice Creation

The transformation of liquid water into solid ice through arcane means represents one of the most deceptively simple yet catastrophically misunderstood applications of thermal manipulation available to the practitioner*. While the naive observer might assume that "making ice" is merely the opposite of "making fire" and therefore equally straightforward†, the thermodynamic realities of instantaneous phase transition present challenges both practical and theoretical‡. The fundamental principle involves the rapid extraction of thermal energy from water molecules via mana conduits**, a process which—contrary to popular belief—does not simply make the heat "disappear" but rather relocates it with alarming efficiency††.

The creation of cloudy versus clear ice serves as an excellent diagnostic for understanding one's technique***. When water freezes naturally at atmospheric pressure, it does so slowly enough that dissolved gases and impurities can migrate away from the freezing front, producing the transparent ice beloved by cocktail enthusiasts and ice sculptors‡‡. Flash-freezing, however, traps these impurities in place, creating the characteristic cloudy appearance that marks amateur work†††—though some practitioners have learned to exploit this effect deliberately, creating ice with deliberate fracture planes for weapon applications‡‡‡. The Académie des Sciences Glaciales maintains that true mastery involves choosing one's freezing speed deliberately****, a philosophy that emerged only after the Incident of 1734****.

The practical applications of instant ice creation extend well beyond party tricks and cooling beverages†††††. Combat applications include the formation of ice barriers—surprisingly effective given ice's tensile strength of approximately 2.8 MPa when properly formed‡‡‡‡—and various weaponry ranging from simple projectiles to elaborate constructs††††††. However, practitioners must account for the fundamental law that thermal energy cannot be destroyed, only relocated*****, leading to the somewhat counterintuitive reality that creating a wall of ice necessarily creates an equivalent amount of heat elsewhere‡‡‡‡‡. The Guild of Thermodynamic Compliance******, established after several notable urban conflagrations, now requires all ice-workers to file Thermal Displacement Plans before operating within city limits.

The advanced practitioner eventually confronts the question of thermal energy disposal, which separates the competent from the catastrophic†††††††. Early approaches typically involved simply dumping the extracted heat "elsewhere," with "elsewhere" being defined with dangerous vagueness‡‡‡‡‡‡—the archives of the Miskatonic Institute contain seventeen separate incident reports involving the phrase "but I was *sure* it was empty space."******* Modern technique emphasizes controlled dispersal: either spreading the heat across a large volume of air (creating the characteristic "warm breeze" of professional ice-work), channeling it into prepared heat sinks†††††††, or—in the most elegant applications—using it to power secondary effects in a closed thermodynamic loop********. The mathematics involved prove surprisingly complex‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, requiring practitioners to maintain running calculations of joules transferred per second********* while simultaneously managing the geometric constraints of ice formation.

*The author learned this the hard way. There was a chandelier involved. We don't discuss it.

†This misconception has led to more destroyed laboratories than any other single fallacy in thermal magic. The Institute for Arcane Safety estimates the annual cost of "making ice the wrong way" at approximately 847,000 gold crowns, not counting the bribes necessary to prevent municipal authorities from asking too many questions.

‡The Thermodynamic Inquisition takes a dim view of practitioners who believe they can violate conservation of energy "just a little bit." Their motto, "Energy Goes Somewhere, Even If You Don't Want It To," is carved into granite above their headquarters. Below it, in smaller letters: "Usually Somewhere Unfortunate."

**A "mana conduit" being the practitioner's preferred metaphysical explanation for what is essentially treating the local quantum field as a very cold washcloth and wringing heat out of it. The physics department and the thaumaturgy department still aren't speaking to each other about this.

††The exact relocation being the critical question, which we shall address after several more paragraphs of building dramatic tension and avoiding the actual answer. This is called "academic writing."

***The Guild of Ice Sculptors has fourteen distinct terms for varieties of cloudiness, each implying different levels of professional incompetence. The mildest, "morning-frost opacity," suggests merely hurried work. The most severe, "Lundgren's Catastrophe," refers to ice so uniformly cloudy that it suggests the practitioner was creating ice while actively on fire. ‡This happened exactly once, in 1823, to Apprentice Lundgren. He survived. The ice sculpture did not. Nor did the competition hall. ‡‡The judges awarded him third place posthumously anyway, citing "certainly memorable" as justification.

‡‡In the old days—and by old days, we mean before the Treaty of Arctic Understanding in 1612—it was considered perfectly acceptable to leave dissolved air in ice for "character." Then the first ice bridge collapsed during a royal procession. The subsequent investigation revealed that "character" and "structural integrity" exist in inverse proportion. †The bridge manufacturer's defense of "but it looked so pretty" did not survive contact with the legal system.

†††Usually in the form of shrapnel. The cautionary tale of Master Frostworth's exploding ice dagger has been told to apprentices for three centuries, with increasing levels of exaggeration. ††The current version involves seventeen innocent bystanders, a priceless vase, and the Queen's favorite corgi. The actual incident involved one moderately guilty bystander (Frostworth himself) and his own foot.

‡‡‡The Society for Creative Ice Destruction publishes an annual manual of structural weak points in ice formations. It is theoretically intended for safety inspectors. In practice, 94% of copies are purchased by combat mages. The Society maintains plausible deniability.

****"Deliberately" here being the key word. The difference between "deliberate cloudy ice for structural purposes" and "I panicked and froze it too fast" is about 23% actual technique and 77% convincing justification after the fact.

*****The Incident of 1734, known formally as "L'Affaire de la Glace Explosive" and informally as "When Fontainebleau Palace Got Very Briefly Much Warmer," involved Court Magician Beaumont's attempt to create an ice palace in the throne room as a birthday surprise. He did create the ice palace. He also created, through poor thermal energy management, what witnesses described as "a summer day in Hell" in the adjacent wine cellar. The wine survived. The bottles did not. King Louis XV was not amused, though he did apparently enjoy the impromptu hot tub that appeared in the dungeon.

†††††The author once froze a colleague's coffee as a prank and was forced to attend six mandatory seminars on "appropriate workplace behavior." The colleague maintains she deserved it. The Workplace Harmony Committee disagrees. The coffee remains a point of contention.

‡‡‡‡For comparison, granite has a tensile strength of approximately 4.8 MPa, meaning properly made ice is roughly 58.3% as strong as rock, a statistic that surprises most apprentices until they remember that glaciers literally carve mountains. ‡The realization usually occurs mid-complaint about how "ice is just frozen water and therefore weak." The subsequent embarrassment is considered pedagogically valuable.

††††††Including, but not limited to: ice spears (banned in seven kingdoms after the Piercing Incident of 1456), ice swords (legal but impractical, melting times average 4.7 minutes in combat conditions), ice shields (surprisingly effective, melting time: 12-15 minutes), and ice golems (legal, effective, but require thermal management plans spanning multiple pages and the patience of a saint). ††There was also, briefly, a fad for ice armor in the late 1600s. It ended when someone pointed out that wearing frozen water in combat meant essentially carrying your own cold bath, and that "dramatic entrance value" did not offset "hypothermia likelihood." †††The fad's originator, Lord Chilblain the Damp, is not mentioned in polite society.

*****This law is older than human civilization. The first beings to discover it were probably bacteria, who kept their thoughts on the matter to themselves. The second were the Elder Things‡, who wrote extensive treatises in languages that hurt to read. The third were humans, who immediately began looking for loopholes.

  description: `# Aquatic Adaptation: Magical Underwater Breathing

The human respiratory system, despite millennia of evolution and several strongly-worded letters to the relevant authorities*, remains stubbornly optimized for atmospheric breathing. This fundamental limitation has frustrated underwater enthusiasts since the Late Mythic Period, when the god Poseidon† famously refused to issue gills to land-dwellers on the grounds that "they'd only abuse them."** The development of magical underwater breathing techniques therefore represents a triumph of arcane innovation over biological inflexibility, though practitioners are strongly advised to master the prerequisite water-shaping skills before attempting any of the methods described herein***.

The simplest approach involves creating and maintaining an air pocket around the head—what the Department of Aquatic Sorcery dismissively calls "the bubble method"†. This technique, while conceptually straightforward for anyone who has successfully shaped water into basic forms, presents numerous practical challenges. The enchantment must continuously replenish oxygen while expelling carbon dioxide††, maintain consistent air pressure despite water depth†††, prevent the bubble from drifting away during movement‡, and resist the natural tendency of water to reclaim its space‡‡. Duration is typically limited to thirty to forty minutes‡‡‡ for trained practitioners, after which point the oxygen content drops below safe levels§ and the caster experiences what researchers term "profound aquatic disappointment."§§

The gill simulation method represents a more sophisticated but considerably more hazardous approach to underwater breathing. Rather than rejecting the properties of water, this technique temporarily modifies the caster's respiratory system to extract dissolved oxygen directly from the surrounding medium§§§. The process involves restructuring lung tissue into pseudo-branchial formations*, carefully balancing osmotic pressure**, and convincing one's cellular biology that this is a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing***. Success rates among properly trained mages exceed seventy-three percent†, though the remaining twenty-seven percent††† experience sensations variously described as "unfortunate," "deeply regrettable," or "like drowning, but with extra steps."‡‡

Perhaps the most underestimated aspect of underwater breathing magic concerns pressure equalization at depth§. The human body, it transpires, was not designed to function at pressures exceeding three atmospheres§§, and simply enabling breathing does not exempt the practitioner from the laws of physics§§§. Descent beyond twenty meters without proper pressure compensation results in what the Guild of Depth-Walkers euphemistically calls "structural reorganization"**—a condition that, while technically survivable, often requires extensive reconstructive thaumaturgy and several awkward conversations with healers††. The ancient Atlanteans*** supposedly solved this problem through a combination of gradual acclimatization‡‡‡ and architectural hubris§, though the reliability of their methods remains difficult to verify given their civilization's current§§ underwater status§§§§.

A final cautionary note for the overly ambitious: the question "why can't I just breathe water magically?" has been posed by every generation of aquatic mages since the First Submersion*. The answer remains consistent: because water, regardless of its oxygen content, is fundamentally not air. Attempts to simply command one's lungs to process water as if it were gaseous result in what is technically still drowning**, just with more determination and a substantial magical signature†††. The Council of Elements has issued no fewer than forty-seven warnings‡‡‡‡ on this subject, each more emphatic than the last, yet every decade produces a new crop of practitioners who believe themselves the exception§. They are not the exception§§§.

\* The Department of Biological Complaints receives approximately twelve thousand such letters annually, filed primarily by wizards, deep-sea enthusiasts, and one particularly persistent merman from the North Sea. None have been answered, as evolution has no forwarding address.

† Not that Poseidon, obviously. The other one. From the Tertiary Pantheon. The one who ran a fish shop in Athens for three centuries before anyone noticed. See Thaddeus Barnacle's "Gods in Retail: A Theological Crisis."

** This decision was made during the Treaty of Tides in 2,347 BCE, immediately after humans demonstrated they could not be trusted with flippers, let alone gills. The incident involving the Sacred Dolphins remains sealed in Atlantean archives.

*** Failure to master basic water-shaping before attempting underwater breathing results in what the Medical Journal of Aquatic Accidents calls "aggressive hydration"—a condition that is exactly as unpleasant as it sounds. The survival rate is encouraging at 94%, though 73% of survivors report never wanting to see water again, which presents obvious lifestyle challenges.

† Professor Agatha Deepwater of the Submarine Academy of Thaumaturgical Arts coined this term in 1873, shortly before her controversial lecture "Just Put a Bucket on Your Head: Why Simple Solutions Are Usually Wrong." The lecture hall was flooded within minutes—coincidentally, she claimed.

†† The biochemistry involved is elegant in theory. In practice, it requires maintaining seven simultaneous enchantments† while underwater, each of which must be recalibrated every three minutes. The Guild of Bubble-Mages reports that 89% of failures occur when practitioners become distracted by fish.

† These enchantments are: oxygen_replenishment, carbon_scrubbing, pressure_maintenance, bubble_cohesion, thermal_regulation, taste_amelioration (the bubble develops a peculiar metallic flavor after ten minutes), and emergency_surface_propulsion. The eighth enchantment, dignity_preservation, was deprecated in 1923 after being deemed "aspirational rather than practical."

††† A particularly tedious process that involves continuously monitoring ambient CO2 levels while simultaneously watching for predators, navigating, and maintaining the seven core enchantments. Multitasking ability is the primary predictor of success, which explains why jugglers make excellent aquatic mages.

‡ This is more problematic than it initially appears. The natural shape of an air bubble underwater is spherical, which means any movement causes it to attempt rolling†. Practitioners quickly learn to modify the bubble's shape to something resembling a diving helmet, though this requires yet another continuous enchantment. See the addendum: "Why Everything Underwater Requires More Enchantments Than You'd Think."

† Bubbles possess what the philosopher Immanuel Kelp called "spherical ambition"—a term that sounds profound but simply means they want to be round and will seize any opportunity to pursue this goal, regardless of whether your head is currently inside them.

‡‡ Water, according to the Elemental Treatise of Fluid Dynamics, "remembers where it used to be and remains slightly offended about being displaced." This is not technically true, but it helps students understand why water pressure behaves vindictively toward air pockets.

‡‡‡ Extended duration variants exist but require pre-casting preparation rituals lasting longer than most people want to spend underwater anyway. The record holder, Archmage Wilhelmina Wetfoot, maintained a breathing bubble for seventeen hours in 1891, though she admitted afterward that "it stopped being fun after the first twenty minutes and became a matter of pure spite."

§ Safe oxygen levels in a confined air pocket begin at 21% and decline to dangerous levels (below 17%) surprisingly quickly. The Department of Underwater Safety maintains detailed charts showing the relationship between bubble volume, caster respiratory rate, and inevitable panic. The charts are not encouraging.

§§ Those who ignore the oxygen depletion warnings describe the experience as "like falling asleep, but wetter and with more regret." The automated magical alert system that triggers at 18% oxygen was installed after the Incident of 1847†, which affected forty-seven practitioners simultaneously during the Annual Underwater Chess Championship.

† Nobody wants to talk about the Incident of 1847. The official report is sealed. Survivors signed non-disclosure agreements. The only confirmed facts are: it involved chess, it happened underwater, and afterwards the word "checkmate" was briefly banned in all Aquatic Academies. Make of that what you will.

  description: `THE RESTORATIVE FLOW: WATER MAGIC FOR HEALING

The practice of imbuing water with curative properties represents one of the oldest confluences of elemental manipulation and life magic, dating back to the Third Age when the Hydrothaumaturgical Society first demonstrated that water could be convinced* to remember wellness better than it remembered wounds. The fundamental principle operates on the understanding that water, being the substance most intimately connected with living tissue†, can serve as a carrier medium for vitalistic resonance‡, though one must be extraordinarily careful about what else the water might be remembering at the time**.

The initial stage of preparing healing waters requires the practitioner to infuse clean water†† with concentrated life energy, a process that the Institute of Benevolent Fluid Dynamics describes as "teaching water to care"‡‡. This is accomplished through sustained meditation while in physical contact with the water, projecting one's own vital force into the liquid medium while maintaining the specific intent of restoration and regeneration***. The water will gradually acquire a faint luminescence††† - typically described as similar to moonlight filtered through leaves‡‡‡ - and will remain potent for approximately forty-seven hours**** before reverting to ordinary water that just happens to glow slightly, which is mostly harmless.

Once properly prepared, healing water serves multiple therapeutic functions with remarkable efficacy. When applied to open wounds, it performs the dual action of cleansing the injury while simultaneously preventing infection†††† - the magically enhanced liquid appears to possess an innate hostility toward foreign contaminants‡‡‡‡, though scholars debate whether this represents true awareness or merely enthusiastic chemical behavior*****. More significantly, healing water dramatically accelerates the natural regeneration of soft tissues, reducing healing time for cuts, burns, and similar injuries by approximately 78.3%†††††, though one must apply the water consistently and, ideally, not while also applying things that counteract healing‡‡‡‡‡.

However - and this caveat cannot be emphasized strongly enough******* - healing water possesses distinct and immutable limitations that have been tragically ignored throughout history. The magic works exclusively on soft tissue damage; it cannot knit broken bones†††††† (use bone-singing for that‡‡‡‡‡‡), cure systemic diseases********, or break curses*********, despite what certain overly optimistic practitioners have claimed. The water can accelerate what the body would naturally repair; it cannot impose new order where none existed, rewrite fundamental biology, or argue with death when death has made up its mind. The distinction between "healing" and "miraculous resurrection" must be maintained, though approximately thirty-seven percent of all healing water incidents involve someone learning this distinction the hard way.

*The anthropomorphization of water in thaumaturgical texts remains controversial. Dr. Elsbeth Waverly of the Anthropomorphic Substance Studies Department insists that "water doesn't need convincing, it needs proper instruction," but her colleagues note that she also talks to her research samples and claims they talk back. They have not invited her to department meetings since the incident with the sympathetically attuned coffee urn.

†Water comprises approximately 60% of human body mass, 73% of cats (explaining much†), and according to entirely unverified reports, 94% of certain aquatic demons who really should have thought about the implications before choosing that particular physical form.

††The average human body contains approximately 42 liters of water, suggesting that the theoretical maximum volume of healing water one could create from one's own bodily fluids is... substantial but inadvisable. The Council of Reasonable Magic prohibits this line of inquiry.

‡"Vitalistic resonance" is the academic term. The common term among practicing healers is "the good wiggle," which is technically more accurate but less likely to secure research funding.

**The documented case of the Perpetually Mildewed Monastery of St. Aquifer serves as a cautionary tale. The monks collected rainwater from their roof for healing purposes, forgetting that their roof was also home to several generations of pigeons. The water did indeed remember something, but wellness was not it.

***This typically takes between fifteen and thirty minutes for a novice practitioner, though Master Healer Cornelius "Quick-Pour" Wethersby claimed he could do it in forty-five seconds. Subsequent investigation revealed he was simply projecting confidence into the water, which is not the same thing but did seem to work approximately one time in twelve, which he considered acceptable odds. He was asked to retire after the incident with the Duchess's supposedly-healed foot‡*.

‡*The Duchess's foot was fine. Her confidence in the medical establishment was not.

†††The Chromathaumaturgical Society maintains that this luminescence occurs at approximately 487 nanometers, which they insist is "scientifically significant." When pressed, they admit they just like having precise measurements for things. They have been measuring everything since their founding in 1432, when their charter was accidentally written to require "exhaustive documentation of all observable phenomena," and they have interpreted this very literally indeed.

‡‡The water doesn't actually care in any emotional sense. It's magic, not a therapist. Though there was that one experimental batch prepared by an empath that reportedly DID care, and then cared TOO MUCH, and had to be disposed of when it started trying to heal paper cuts that hadn't happened yet.

‡‡‡This description appears in 73.6% of all historical texts on healing water, suggesting either profound universal truth or that everyone was copying from the same source manuscript. The source manuscript, attributed to the probably-fictional "Healer Moonleaf" of the Definitely-Fictional "Green Grove Academy," has never been found, leading to the uncomfortable theory that we've all been collectively hallucinating the same metaphor for six centuries.

****47 hours, 13 minutes, and approximately 22 seconds, according to the Precise Time-Keeping Division of the Grand Chronothaumaturgical Institute, who were invited to measure this exactly once and now won't stop sending updated measurements. Their most recent communication included potency decay rates calculated to seventeen decimal places and a graph. Nobody requested the graph.

†††††Foreign contaminants include bacteria, dirt, curse residue, and - in one documented case - a very small confused sprite who had fallen into a wound during a gardening accident‡†. The sprite was expelled with considerable force and indignation. It filed a complaint, which was dismissed on grounds that one shouldn't loiter in open wounds regardless of the circumstances.

‡†The patient had been pruning rose bushes known to be inhabited by garden sprites. The sprites had posted warning signs. The signs were in Sprite Common, which most humans cannot read, leading to ongoing diplomatic tensions about signage requirements in mixed-occupancy gardens.

‡‡‡‡The awareness debate has consumed considerable academic energy. One faction insists enhanced water develops something resembling consciousness. Another insists this is pathetic fallacy. A third faction, led by the enigmatic Professor Somethingorother (first name long forgotten, possibly never known), suggests that the distinction between "behaving as if conscious" and "being conscious" is academic navel-gazing, and if it cleans your wound either way, perhaps shut up and be grateful. This faction has been officially censured seventeen times but keeps getting invited to conferences because they're right and everyone knows it.

*****The chemical behavior theory is supported by the fact that healing water becomes slightly acidic (pH 5.8-6.2) and demonstrates oxidative properties consistent with... actually, the chemistry is complicated and involves terms like "hydroxyl radical cascade formation." The important point is that bacteria don't like it, and bacteria don't need to like it, and telling bacteria that you're sorry but this is for their own good doesn't help anyone.

††††††Reduction in healing time, documented across 2,847 cases by the Statistical Analysis Wing of St. Ophelia's Hospital for Magical Maladies‡‡. Margin of error: ±0.23%. St. Ophelia's is very proud of their margins of error. They have a entire office dedicated to calculating them. That office has its own margin of error, but we don't talk about that.

‡‡St. Ophelia herself was allegedly healed by magical water after a dragon-related incident in 843 CE, though historical records are unclear whether the water healed her or she healed herself and the water just happened to be there. She is now the patron saint of both healers and people who are tired of explaining what actually happened, a combination that works better than one might expect.
