  description: `# Mindless Servants: The Art of Zombie Animation

The animation of deceased human remains as servile entities represents one of necromancy's most fundamental applications, dating back to the First Necromantic Revolution* of approximately 1247 CE†. Unlike more sophisticated forms of undead creation, zombie animation requires no consultation with the deceased's soul‡, no binding of external spirits, or indeed any particular respect for the individual whose mortal vessel one is presently commandeering**. The process relies entirely upon the caster's own mana reserves channeled through the corpse's existing nervous system††, creating what scholars at the Unseen University describe as "a sort of meat puppet, but less entertaining and considerably more disturbing at dinner parties"‡‡.

The technical requirements are, in truth, quite straightforward. One requires: a corpse (the fresher the better***), an intact nervous system†††, a working knowledge of the relevant incantations‡‡‡, and a complete absence of squeamishness****. The caster's mana flows through the preserved neural pathways much as electricity flows through copper wire, though the Guild of Comparative Necromancy notes this is "a terrible analogy that causes no end of confusion among students who then attempt to attach their zombies to lightning rods"*****. The resulting animated corpse possesses no intelligence, no will, and no particular desire to eat brains††††† - these being common misconceptions perpetuated by sensationalist pamphlets and that regrettable incident in Lower Ankh‡‡‡‡.

What the zombie does possess is an ability to follow simple, direct commands: "walk here," "carry this," "stop shambling toward the High Priest during his sermon"‡‡‡‡‡. More complex instructions invariably result in what the Lancre College of Witches terms "creative misinterpretation"******, though the zombies themselves are not being creative so much as executing the most literal possible version of ambiguous orders******. Additionally, practitioners must accept that decay continues throughout the animation period†††††† - there is no magical preservation involved, merely magical motivation‡‡‡‡‡‡. The Morticians' Guild maintains extensive charts correlating ambient temperature, humidity, and the number of days before one's zombie servant becomes what they delicately term "structurally inadvisable"********.

It bears emphasizing that zombie animation is necromancy at its most utilitarian - a simple spell for simple tasks, requiring no grand rituals or midnight graveyards*********. One need not sell one's soul, make pacts with demons, or even stay up particularly late††††††††. The primary dangers are not supernatural but practical: overextending one's mana reserves‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, failing to properly preserve the nervous system before animation**********, or discovering mid-spell that one's corpse was not, in fact, as deceased as initially assessed***********. The latter, while statistically rare, is considered sufficiently problematic that the College of Necromancers now requires all students to complete a certified Death Detection course†††††††††† before progressing to animation studies.

The ethical considerations surrounding zombie animation have been debated for centuries, with philosophers divided into roughly three camps: those who find it an abhorrent violation of human dignity‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡, those who argue the deceased no longer require their physical forms and might as well be useful************, and those who simply wish everyone would stop leaving animated corpses blocking the public thoroughfares*************. Modern necromantic practice attempts to balance these concerns through regulation rather than prohibition, requiring that practitioners obtain either written permission from the deceased before their death or appropriate licenses from municipal authorities††††††††††††. The effectiveness of this system varies considerably by jurisdiction‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

*The term "Revolution" is somewhat misleading, as it primarily involved a handful of necromancers realizing they could animate corpses without all the tedious soul-binding rituals of traditional ghost-raising. The discovery was made by Mortimer the Mediocre, who was attempting a resurrection spell, got the words wrong, and accidentally created what his journal describes as "a shambling assistant who never complains about working conditions." Within a decade, every necromancer worth their salt had abandoned the complex methods in favor of Mortimer's accidental shortcut.

†Some scholars place it earlier, around 1180 CE, but those scholars also believe the world is flat and that dragons are "just large chickens with attitude problems." The Historical Necromancy Society has officially dated it to 1247 based on the discovery of Mortimer's journal in a cave in the Ramtops, though the journal was being used by a troll as a doorstop**, which raises questions about preservation conditions.

**The troll, when interviewed, stated the journal "tasted terrible" and "not even good for back-scratching." This level of literary criticism is typical of trolls.

‡This represents the fundamental distinction between zombie animation and other forms of undeath. Ghosts involve souls, liches involve souls, vampires involve souls (sort of***), but zombies involve nothing more ethereal than leftover nervous tissue and a mana battery. It's the difference between hiring an employee and reprogramming a golem.

***The nature of vampire souls is a matter of some theological debate. The Church of Om insists they have souls, they're just using them incorrectly. The Patrician's position is that anyone who pays taxes has a soul, regardless of whether they have a pulse. Vampires themselves mostly just want to be left alone to brood attractively in castles.

‡‡From the famous paper "On the Social Awkwardness of Undead Servants at Formal Gatherings" by Professor Hix, which notes that while zombies can be taught to serve canapés, they cannot be taught not to drop bits of themselves into the punch bowl. The paper concludes: "Just use regular staff. Really."

**The acquisition of corpses for necromantic study follows strict legal guidelines††. The days of midnight grave-robbing are, legally speaking, behind us. Mostly.

††The Corpse Procurement Act of 1789 established that necromancers may only use: (1) bodies explicitly donated for necromantic research, (2) unclaimed bodies from municipal morgues, (3) criminals executed by the state, or (4) any corpse they can prove they personally created through legal means, which opens philosophical questions about self-defense statutes that no one really wants to explore. The black market for illegal corpses was valued at approximately 1.2 million gold pieces annually in 1850‡, though this figure has declined with improved enforcement.

‡According to the Treasury Department's "Report on Illicit Trade in Previously Living Persons," which makes for surprisingly gripping reading if you enjoy dry economic analysis mixed with body counts.

††The nervous system must maintain structural integrity throughout the spine, primary nerve branches, and crucially, the connection to the brain stem. Damage to any of these renders the corpse "mechanically unresponsive," which is to say, it lies there and does nothing except slowly decompose. The famous case of Jenkins the Incompetent involved a necromancer who attempted to animate a corpse that had been partially consumed by bears. The result was described as "the most expensive way to create a paperweight ever documented."

‡‡‡The basic incantation, in High Necromantic, translates roughly to "You there, flesh-prison, house this energy and move about a bit." The verbosity of necromantic spellwork owes much to the field's origins in scholarly circles where publishing word count directly correlated to academic prestige. A modern simplified version exists ("Rise and serve") but is considered vulgar by traditionalists‡‡.

‡‡Traditionalists also insist on wearing ceremonial robes that haven't been fashionable since the 1600s and referring to each other exclusively by pompous titles. The Necromantic Tradition Society is, by common agreement, insufferable at parties.

***Corpse freshness directly correlates to zombie responsiveness. A body dead less than 24 hours provides optimal neural conductivity. After three days, responsiveness drops by roughly 40%. After a week, you're essentially trying to puppet a sack of mostly-liquid. The Guild of Necromancers publishes a "Freshness Index" that reads disturbingly like a fishmonger's guide****.

****The comparison is more apt than most necromancers wish to admit. Both professions involve careful inspection of deceased matter, concern about decomposition rates, and the perpetual smell of death. Fish vendors are generally more popular at social gatherings.

****Squeamishness has ended more necromantic careers than any other factor, including divine retribution, mob violence,`,

  description: `BEYOND FLESH: ANIMATING SKELETAL REMAINS

The transition from zombie animation to skeletal animation represents what the Académie Mortelle des Sciences refers to as "the great unburdening"*—the moment when the aspiring necromancer realizes that muscles, while useful for locomotion in living creatures, prove surprisingly inconvenient when trying to animate the deceased. Unlike the relatively straightforward process of reanimating a corpse with its musculature intact†, skeletal animation requires the practitioner to essentially become a puppeteer working with invisible strings of pure necromantic force, holding together a collection of calcium deposits that have no natural inclination to remain associated with one another‡. The difficulty increase is substantial: where zombie creation might be compared to teaching a somewhat recalcitrant student to walk, skeletal animation is akin to teaching two hundred and six separate students to form a synchronized dance troupe while blindfolded§.

The fundamental challenge lies in the fact that bones, when stripped of their connecting tissues, demonstrate what Professor Mortimer Grimshaw termed "skeletal independence syndrome"**—each bone's cheerful assumption that it need not cooperate with its neighbors. The necromancer must therefore create a lattice of dark energy that functions simultaneously as tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and a general sense of team spirit††. This energy matrix is visible to those with the appropriate sight as a faint violet glow surrounding the skeleton, though it appears as a considerably brighter and more alarming glow to the skeleton itself, which is why newly-animated skeletons often spend their first few minutes examining their hands with what can only be described as existential horror‡‡. The energy requirement is approximately 40% higher than for zombie animation§§, but the resulting undead servant proves significantly more durable, faster***, and less likely to leave bits of itself trailing behind during vigorous activity†††.

The superiority of complete skeletons over fragmentary remains cannot be overstated‡‡‡. While it is theoretically possible to animate a skeleton missing up to 23% of its original bones§§§, the results prove increasingly unstable as the percentage rises****. The reason lies in what Dr. Elspeth Marrowdark calls "osseous memory"††††—the bones' tendency to remember where they ought to be in relation to one another. A complete skeleton animates with a sort of institutional knowledge of how to function as a bipedal entity; a partial skeleton must be micromanaged by the necromancer's will at every moment‡‡‡‡, rather like trying to pilot a ship while simultaneously serving as every member of the crew§§§§. The Incident at Greyhollow Academy*****, where a student attempted to animate seventeen skeletons simultaneously using only their collective femurs, remains a cautionary tale about the importance of structural completeness††††† and also about the importance of not trying to impress visiting dignitaries‡‡‡‡‡.

The practical advantages of skeletal undead extend beyond their improved speed and durability. They require no feeding§§§§§, produce no odor******, lack the philosophical complications that arise when zombies recognize their former relatives†††††† , and can be stored in significantly less space‡‡‡‡‡‡. Their joints, now freed from the constraints of actual anatomy, can rotate in ways that living creatures would find agonizing§§§§§§, making them excellent for reaching items on high shelves or frightening the overly curious*******. The necromantic energy that binds them also repairs minor damage automatically††††††† —a feature that proves invaluable when one's undead servants develop an unfortunate habit of walking into furniture‡‡‡‡‡‡‡.

However, the aspiring bone-animator must approach this branch of necromancy with appropriate caution and, ideally, a well-stocked first aid kit§§§§§§§. The consequences of imperfect animation range from the merely embarrassing (skeletons that walk backward********, collapse into component parts when startled†††††††† , or develop an obsessive need to reorganize objects by size‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡) to the genuinely dangerous (skeletons that mistake the necromancer for an enemy§§§§§§§§, attempt to reclaim their missing pieces from living donors*********, or achieve a form of independent consciousness and file for workers' rights††††††††† ). As the ancient text "Ye Grimme Booke of Bones" advises: "Knowe thy skeleton, or thy skeleton shall knowe thee, and the knowing shall not be comfortable."‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡


FOOTNOTES

*Though whether this unburdening refers to the removal of flesh from bones or the removal of illusions from the practitioner's mind regarding the ease of necromancy remains a subject of spirited debate at their annual conferences. The debates have been described as "surprisingly violent for people who work primarily with the already-dead."

†See the prerequisite text "Zombie Creation Basics," available in three volumes, nineteen appendices, and one hastily-written pamphlet titled "No, Seriously, Stop Trying to Animate Your Relatives."

‡Dr. Cornelius Bonewraith's famous experiment demonstrated that bones, when left to their own devices after the dissolution of connecting tissue, will scatter across an average distance of 12.3 meters, with small bones (phalanges, carpals) traveling significantly farther, up to 47 meters in cases of steep inclines or strong winds. His paper, "The Migratory Patterns of Post-Mortem Skeletal Components," won the Necromantic Academy's award for Most Unnecessarily Thorough Research in 1847.

§The Greymarsh School of Necromancy's introductory course famously includes a practical exercise where students must convince their own toes to work together—an exercise that proves surprisingly difficult and which has resulted in 73% of students developing a permanent limp and newfound sympathy for the coordination challenges of undeath.

**Originally termed this in his seminal work "Why Won't They Just Stay Together: A Meditation on Bones and Betrayal" (1823). Professor Grimshaw was found three years later living in a cabin in the woods, surrounded by complete skeletons meticulously wired together with actual wire, having given up on necromantic energy entirely. He was reportedly very happy.

††The creation of this matrix requires approximately 47 minutes of continuous concentration for a novice necromancer, 12 minutes for a journeyman, and 3-4 minutes for a master. The record is held by the legendary Arch-Necromancer Valeria Deathwhisper at 43 seconds, though several witnesses noted that she cheated by having pre-warmed her necromantic energies‡ and may have used performance-enhancing meditation techniques.

‡This practice is controversial and banned in official Academy competitions.

‡‡This phenomenon was first documented by Dr. Heinrich Gravemann in his observational study "The Phenomenology of Undead Self-Awareness and Its Manifestation in Phalangeal Tremors" (1891). He noted that 89% of newly-animated skeletons spent between 4-7 minutes staring at their hands, 6% attempted to remove their own skulls for closer examination, and 5% simply stood motionless, presumably contemplating the existential implications of their condition. The remaining percentages were lost to rounding errors and one skeleton that immediately ran away and was never recovered.

***Skeletons can achieve running speeds of up to 31 kilometers per hour, compared to zombies' shambling pace of 4-7 kilometers per hour. This fact was discovered during the Great Undead Race of 1776§, an event that is no longer held due to complaints from the public, the city guard, and several traumatized livestock.

§The race was organized by the overly enthusiastic Society for the Advancement of Necromantic Athletics. It ended when the skeletons, having vastly outpaced their zombie competitors, became confused about the finish line location and scattered across three provinces. Some are allegedly still running.

  description: `# Armies of the Dead: Mass Undead Animation Techniques

The fundamental challenge of mass undead animation lies not in the initial casting—any competent necromancer who has mastered the basics of zombie creation* and skeleton animation** can theoretically animate dozens of corpses—but in the sustained concentration required to maintain control over what amounts to a small battalion of the recently deceased†. The mana cost, contrary to popular belief, does not simply multiply linearly with each additional corpse; rather, it scales according to the Vorkosigan Coefficient‡, which accounts for the increasing metaphysical "weight" of multiple soul-anchors operating in proximity to one another. This exponential growth in mana expenditure has been the downfall of more ambitious necromancers than the Inquisition could ever hope to catch‡‡, though the Inquisition would prefer you didn't know that.

The strategic advantages of a necromantic army are, from a purely military perspective, considerable***. Undead soldiers require no food†††, no sleep‡‡‡, no pay§, and have remarkably low morale issues§§—though the latter is somewhat offset by their tendency to shamble***. The legendary Siege of Khaz-Morok*** demonstrates both the potential and the pitfalls of mass animation: Commander Thrul the Persistent†††† managed to maintain control over 347 skeletons for six consecutive days, ultimately breaking the siege, but required three months of bed rest afterward and reportedly wept when anyone mentioned the word "coordination" for the remainder of his life.

However, the problem of caster fatigue remains the primary limiting factor in sustained necromantic warfare‡‡‡‡. The mental strain of controlling multiple undead simultaneously has been likened to playing chess on forty boards at once§§§, while also conducting an orchestra, performing surgery, and trying to remember if you left the stove on****. The Collegiate Institute for Necromantic Studies†††††† maintains that the theoretical maximum for a single caster operating without assistive artifacts is approximately 180 undead‡‡‡‡‡, though this number assumes ideal conditions, perfect corpse quality, and a necromancer with what the Institute's Director, Professor Yvaine Tombward, describes as "a pathologically organized mind and possibly some form of death wish."

*See "Zombie Creation Basics: A Practical Guide to Reanimating the Recently Deceased Without Losing Your Breakfast" by Magister Cornelius Fleshweaver. The breakfast part is more important than it sounds. The Guild of Necromancers' insurance premiums specifically cover "nausea-related workshop incidents."

**Also by Fleshweaver, though his later work "Skeleton Animation: When Zombies Just Won't Do" was published posthumously after an incident involving a misplaced radius bone and an unfortunate sneeze during a delicate ritual†. He got better, eventually, though he never quite trusted his left arm again.

†The skeleton in question had been a professional mime in life. The irony was not lost on the Academic Review Board, though they did note in their incident report that "at least it couldn't talk."

‡Named after Dr. Mikhail Vorkosigan, who discovered it in 1847 while trying to animate his University's entire donated cadaver collection simultaneously. The resulting "Incident of the Forty-Seven Simultaneous Reanimations" is still used as a cautionary tale in first-year necromancy courses‡‡. Dr. Vorkosigan himself survived but reportedly never looked at a graveyard the same way again.

‡‡The incident resulted in 47 confused corpses, 23 damaged laboratory tables, one destroyed ceiling, the permanent haunting of the East Wing, and a strongly worded memo from the Dean about "acceptable levels of academic enthusiasm."

***The Office of Necromantic Statistics (a surprisingly cheerful sub-department of the Collegium) estimates that approximately 78.3% of necromantic casualties are self-inflicted, usually through overreach. The remaining 21.7% are divided between "righteous mob action" (12%), "vengeful undead" (6.4%), and "misunderstood the recipe" (3.3%)†††.

†††The "misunderstood the recipe" category includes the famous case of Apprentice Morris Fenwick, who confused "grave dirt" with "gravy dirt" and spent three weeks trying to animate a pot roast. The pot roast did not cooperate, though it did develop an unsettling awareness of its surroundings.

‡‡‡Unlike living soldiers, who have been known to complain about nearly everything. The Necromantic Academy's comparative study "Logistical Advantages of Unliving Troops: A Cost-Benefit Analysis" (1734) noted that undead armies save approximately 847 gold pieces per soldier per campaign year in food costs alone§.

§Though this is somewhat offset by the cost of preservative enchantments, replacement limbs, and the considerable expense of hiring bards to write songs that make your army of corpses sound heroic rather than deeply unsettling. The latter has been described by the Society of Martial Chroniclers as "a truly impossible task."

§§The study also noted that undead soldiers never argue about marching order, never complain about the weather§§§, and never ask "are we there yet?" However, they do sometimes develop what the research team termed "autonomous wandering behavior," particularly if the necromancer's concentration lapses during meal breaks.

§§§Though they do occasionally fall apart in extreme heat, leading to the famous military maxim: "Never march your undead army through a desert in summer unless you enjoy reassembling spines."

***The shambling issue has been the subject of considerable debate. Some scholars argue it's a necessary metaphysical limitation**** while others maintain it's simply poor craftsmanship. The Guild of Necromancers has officially declared the debate "resolved" and "please stop sending us letters about it," though the debate continues anyway.

****Professor Emberwick of Dunhallow University published a controversial paper titled "On the Metaphysical Impossibility of Sprinting Skeletons," which argued that the very nature of undeath imposes a maximum velocity of approximately 4.7 miles per hour on reanimated corpses. His follow-up paper, "I Stand Corrected: A Treatise on Being Chased by My Research Subjects," remains a bestseller in necromantic circles.

†††The Siege of Khaz-Morok (1523) lasted for six weeks and is the subject of no fewer than eighteen published histories††††, each contradicting the others on key details such as the actual length of the siege, the number of undead involved, and whether Commander Thrul wore a hat. What they all agree on is that Thrul required extensive psychological counseling afterward and developed a nervous tic whenever someone asked him to "coordinate anything."

††††Including the magnificently unhelpful "A Brief Overview of the Siege of Khaz-Morok" by Professor Wendell Ashmore, which runs to 1,247 pages and includes an entire chapter on the dietary habits of the defending garrison, none of which is relevant to anything.

‡‡‡‡The mental fatigue follows what researchers call the "Dhaka Degradation Curve," named after Necromancer Priya Dhaka, who famously documented her own declining cognitive function over a seven-day period of sustained mass animation‡‡‡‡‡. Her notes from the final day consist largely of drawings of cats and the word "BONES" written increasingly frantically in the margins.

‡‡‡‡‡Dr. Dhaka's research diary is preserved at the Collegium and is considered either a masterwork of scientific self-observation or a cautionary tale about the importance of regular sleep, depending on who you ask. The final entry reads: "Day 7: Everything is bones. I am bones. You are bones. The universe is just bones that haven't happened yet. Must lie down."

  description: `# Thinking Dead: Creating Intelligent Undead Servants

The reanimation of corpses with their original souls intact represents the pinnacle of necromantic achievement, requiring mastery of both corporeal resurrection and soul binding that few practitioners ever attain*. Unlike the shambling zombies of basic necromancy, intelligent undead retain the memories, skills, and personalities they possessed in life—a feature that initially seems advantageous until one considers the implications of forcibly binding a soul back into its own corpse against the natural order†. The theoretical framework was first established by Archmagister Cornelius Gravemoor in his seminal work "On the Voluntary Relinquishment of Death" (which, ironically, contained nothing whatsoever about voluntary participation)‡.

The process requires precise simultaneity: the body must be fresh enough to accept vital energies**, the soul must be captured within moments of death††, and the binding must occur before either component degrades beyond utility‡‡. What makes this particularly challenging is that souls, once separated from their bodies, develop what the Eternal University of Mortingham describes as "extreme reluctance to resume residence in deceased flesh"***—a technical term that translates roughly to "they really, really don't want to go back"†††. The binding ritual thus requires not merely technical proficiency but substantial magical force to overcome the soul's resistance, which sets up the fundamental problem that has plagued necromancers since the technique's inception: cramming someone's consciousness back into their own corpse tends to make them rather cross with you‡‡‡.

The loyalty problem proves even more intractable than the technical challenges. Approximately 94.7% of successfully created intelligent undead harbor what the Guild of Necromantic Studies euphemistically terms "negative sentiment" toward their creators****, ranging from mild resentment to homicidal rage†††† (with homicidal rage representing roughly 89.2% of documented cases). This hostility stems from several factors: the indignity of being dead, the horror of being undead, the loss of mortality's release, and—most significantly—the memory of everything the necromancer did to accomplish the binding‡‡‡‡. Early practitioners attempted various control measures, from traditional magical compulsions to elaborate systems of metaphysical leverage, though the historical record suggests these met with decidedly mixed results*****.

Modern approaches to the loyalty dilemma have evolved in three primary directions, none entirely satisfactory. The first involves selecting subjects who might theoretically consent to the transformation—warriors seeking to continue their service, scholars unwilling to abandon their research, or the occasionally suicidal volunteer—though obtaining meaningful consent before death remains legally and ethically problematic******. The second approach employs extensive magical controls and geas-work, effectively reducing the intelligent undead to sophisticated automatons and rather defeating the purpose of preserving their intelligence in the first place††††††. The third and most successful method—though "successful" must be understood in relative terms—involves creating conditions where the undead's self-interest aligns with service, typically through promises of eventual release, revenge against third parties, or access to resources only the necromancer can provide‡‡‡‡‡‡. The resulting wights, when successfully created and managed, represent formidable servants combining martial prowess, magical capability, and strategic thinking*******, though they also represent a constant and substantial security risk********.

## Footnotes

*The Arcane Consortium estimates that only one in every 847 practicing necromancers ever successfully creates an intelligent undead, and of these, approximately 43% do not survive the first week following creation. These statistics do not include necromancers who succeed in creating intelligent undead but fail to properly document the process due to being murdered by their creation.

†The "natural order" being somewhat flexible depending on one's theological framework, though most religious institutions agree that "being dead" should generally be considered a stable state rather than a transitional phase. The Church of the Eternal Slumber has been particularly vocal on this point, especially since the incident at their Grand Cathedral in 1247††.

††When Archbishop Mortimer Gravesend attempted to demonstrate that death could be "spiritually educational" by volunteering for temporary soul-binding, then became so annoyed at being resurrected that he spent the remainder of his undead existence writing heretical pamphlets about the inadequacy of church burial rites.

‡Gravemoor's work built upon earlier research by Dame Ophelia Blackmoor, who discovered that souls remained tethered to corpses for a brief period post-mortem. Her notes contain the memorable phrase "the soul lingers like a houseguest who knows they've overstayed but hasn't worked out the logistics of leaving"‡‡. Unfortunately, her research was interrupted when she accidentally created seventeen intelligent undead simultaneously and was forced to flee her tower wearing only a nightgown and one slipper.

‡‡Blackmoor's more detailed observations were lost in what became known as the Seventeen Grudges Incident, though surviving fragments suggest she'd discovered that the duration of soul-lingering varied inversely with the quality of the person's final meal. A footnote in her personal diary reads: "Note—subjects who died after consuming bad fish stick around much longer. Unclear if related to unfinished business or simply gastric distress"†††.

†††The Blackmoor Fragments, as they're now known, were recovered from various locations around her former tower, including one particularly detailed section found inside a badger's den three miles away. Scholars remain divided on whether the badger stole it or was attempting to return it.

**"Fresh enough" being defined by the College of Corporeal Studies as "no more than 47 hours post-mortem for summer months, 63 hours for winter, though these figures assume proper cold storage and minimal decomposition." The College maintains extensive charts accounting for climate, cause of death, and body mass index****. They are very proud of these charts.

****The charts occupy seventeen volumes and include such helpful calculations as "Adjustment Factor for Death by Bee Stings (Multiple)" and "Compensatory Measures for Subjects Who Died Laughing." The College's Librarian refuses to discuss how they obtained the empirical data‡‡.

‡‡Though rumors persist of a "Testing Period" in the College's early history, during which graduate students were required to submit "Detailed Decomposition Observations" as part of their thesis work. The College's official position is that these rumors are "unfounded, slanderous, and also please stop asking about the basement."

††Though the exact window varies. The Mortingham Institute's Department of Soul Mechanics has calculated that upper-class souls remain available for 23% longer than peasant souls—a finding they attribute to "increased soul density from leisure time and philosophical contemplation" rather than any intrinsic moral superiority. This conclusion has done nothing to stop the aristocracy from citing it as evidence of their spiritual advancement‡‡‡.

‡‡‡The Peasants' Union of Practical Necromancy has issued a counter-study suggesting that aristocratic souls stick around longer because they're "too entitled to accept they're dead," but this remains academically unverified due to insufficient funding for lower-class necromantic research.

‡‡‡The binding process involves approximately 47 distinct ritual components, performed in sequence, while simultaneously maintaining three active containment circles and chanting in Proto-Nethric. The Ritual Choreography Department at Mortholme Academy describes it as "like juggling flaming swords while doing your taxes and also you're on fire"****.

****This description appears in the official course handbook, which has been cited in seventeen wrongful death lawsuits brought by students' families. The Academy's legal team maintains that "on fire" was clearly metaphorical, despite evidence to the contrary.

***The technical literature contains extensive debate about whether souls actively resist return or simply lack motivation to cooperate. Professor Elias Deathmoor's "Spiritual Inertia: Resistance or Indifference?" ran to 847 pages and concluded, essentially, that souls don't want to come back and also they'd really rather you stopped trying to make them†††.

†††Deathmoor's follow-up work, "Please Stop, Seriously: A Soul's Perspective on Unwanted Resurrection," was written after he volunteered to be temporarily soul-bound as an experiment. He returned to his body long enough to write the paper, then immediately severed his own soul-binding and ascended to whatever afterlife awaited him, leaving behind only the manuscript and a note reading "Don't."

Souls undergoing this process have been observed (through specialized scrying equipment) making rude gestures at their prospective necromancers. The equipment has become`,

  description: `ETERNAL SERVITUDE: MAKING UNDEAD SELF-SUSTAINING

The fundamental limitation of necromantic practice has long been the practitioner's need to maintain constant mana investment in their animated servants—a requirement that leads to catastrophic failures the moment one's attention wavers, one sleeps, or one is unexpectedly devoured by owlbears*. The development of self-sustaining undead represents perhaps the single most significant advancement in necromantic theory since Maldros the Perpetually Surprised discovered that corpses animated more reliably when one remembered to include the head**. By embedding mana reservoirs within the undead construct itself and enabling the servitor to draw ambient energies from its environment, the necromancer achieves what the Guild of Applied Mortality terms "set it and forget it" necromancy†—a phrase they immediately regretted coining after the Incident at Brackenmoor††.

The theoretical framework rests upon three fundamental principles, each discovered through what the Historical Society of Necromantic Mishaps categorizes as "expensive lessons"‡. First, one must create within the undead servant a reservoir capable of storing mana without degradation‡‡—typically achieved through crystalline matrices derived from soul gems, though the Alternative Materials Working Group has produced a seventeen-thousand-page report on substitutes†††. Second, the construct must possess mechanisms for drawing ambient mana from its surroundings, functioning much like a mill wheel draws power from a flowing stream, except the stream is the fundamental energy of reality and the mill wheel is made of dead tissue‡‡‡. Third, and most critically, these systems must operate in perfect equilibrium: consumption must never exceed intake by more than 0.003%, lest one's eternal servitor become one's temporary servitor who collapses into component parts at an inopportune moment*.

This equilibrium explains the phenomenon of autonomous undead in ancient tombs—constructs that have persisted for millennia without their original animators***. These tomb guardians were created during necromancy's golden age†**, when necromancers had sufficient leisure time to properly embed reservoir systems and tune their servitors to local mana conditions, unlike modern practitioners who attempt the same work while juggling teaching loads, guild politics, and the persistent need to prove to one's mother that necromancy is indeed "a real career"‡**. The tombs themselves function as mana-rich environments, their very stones saturated with death energy from centuries of ritual preparation***, creating what the Eternal Rest Assurance Society terms "perpetual motion in the absence of ethics"†***.

However, the creation of truly permanent undead carries risks that make conventional necromantic practice look positively safe by comparison****. Once a servitor becomes self-sustaining, it no longer requires its creator's mana to persist—which also means it no longer requires its creator's existence to persist‡***. The binding that prevents a self-sustaining undead from developing independent volition must be woven into the reservoir structure itself, carved into the very metaphysical architecture that gives the construct existence*****. The Catalogue of Regrettable Decisions documents 1,247 instances of necromancers who failed to properly implement these bindings, including the cautionary tale of Veritas the Theoretical, who created such magnificently autonomous undead that they continued following his instructions for three hundred years after his death—unfortunately, his last instruction had been "guard this chamber and permit no one to enter," which included the rescue party sent to find him†****.


* The Guild's actuarial tables list "owlbear attack while maintaining seventeen simultaneous undead servitors" as the third leading cause of death among practicing necromancers, after "hubris" and "that's not what that spell does." The tables are updated quarterly and make for surprisingly entertaining reading, particularly the subsection on "creative misapplications of resurrection magic."

** Maldros earned his epithet not from any single moment of surprise but from his habit of expressing astonishment at consequences that any reasonable practitioner would have predicted. His complete works, published posthumously as "Things I Did Not Expect: A Memoir," run to forty-three volumes. Volume seventeen, dedicated entirely to his surprise at being surprised so often, is considered either profound or evidence of concussion—scholarly opinion remains divided.

† The Guild trademarked this phrase in the Year of Unnecessary Litigation and has since sent cease-and-desist orders to three cooking schools, a pottery collective, and a fertility clinic. They have not explained the fertility clinic incident and have asked everyone to stop asking about it.

†† Brackenmoor no longer appears on maps, which the Royal Cartographers' Society officially attributes to "coastal erosion" and unofficially attributes to "approximately forty thousand self-sustaining undead who forgot they were supposed to stop." The zone is now marked with a simple symbol meaning "detour suggested."

‡ The Historical Society's definition of "expensive" includes not only monetary cost but also "fingers lost," "nearby villages evacuated," and "awkward conversations with the Inquisition." Their metrics are devastatingly precise: the average lesson costs 47.3 gold pieces, 1.2 fingers, 0.8 villages, and 3.7 conversations, with a standard deviation that suggests some lessons were more educational than others.

‡‡ Early experiments with organic reservoirs proved unsuccessful when the reservoirs insisted on continuing to decompose regardless of their metaphysical purpose. Professor Threnody's famous paper "On the Stubborn Refusal of Dead Flesh to Maintain Thaumic Coherence" included detailed measurements of reservoir degradation: 12% efficiency loss per day, accelerating to 89% after the first week, culminating in what she termed "catastrophic structural liquefaction"†.

† This is the technical term. The colloquial term is "everything falling apart into a pudious mess," though guild publications refuse to acknowledge this terminology.

††† The working group's obsessive thoroughness has become legendary. Chapter 3,847, "Theoretical Applications of Properly Aged Cheese," spans 214 pages and includes nineteen full-color illustrations. Whether the chapter represents genuine research or an elaborate joke has been debated for thirty years. The working group refuses to clarify, citing "academic mystique."

‡‡‡ The Institute for Thaumic Engineering advises against thinking too hard about the metaphysics of this process, as their research indicates that excessive contemplation of "how the fundamental energy of reality can be harvested by dead tissue" has a 34% correlation with what they term "existential headaches"‡.

‡ Symptoms include questioning the nature of existence, wondering whether consciousness is merely organized energy, and an irresistible urge to write poetry. The Institute recommends strong tea and avoiding philosophy departments.

* The Necromancers' Guild maintains a "Wall of Service Interruptions" documenting particularly unfortunate timing of servitor failures. Highlights include "collapsed while carrying coffin at own master's funeral," "dissolved during crucial peace treaty signing," and simply "wedding."** The plaques are brass and very professionally engraved.

** The guild refuses to specify whose wedding or what was being carried. The disaster was apparently so spectacular that detailed records were sealed for "the dignity of all involved and several uninvolved bystanders."

*** The persistence record belongs to the tomb guardians of Akh-Morath, who have maintained continuous vigilance for 4,237 years without requiring maintenance, consciousness, or coffee breaks***. The Eternal Guardian Monitoring Committee conducts annual wellness checks and reports that the guardians remain "as animated as the day they were animated," which technically means they are unanimously deceased but functional.

*** They do, however, appear to have developed what archaeologists term "a certain attitude" about visitors. Whether this represents genuine undead psychology or merely optimal guardian behavior is debated, though most scholars agree it's safest to avoid testing the question empirically.

†** Sometimes called the Age of Unlived Regrets, spanning approximately 1,200 years before the Reformation of Ethical Concerns Regarding the Treatment of Both the Living and Formerly Living†. Necromancers during this period enjoyed generous research funding, minimal oversight, and an impressive lack of paperwork—a combination that led to stunning theoretical advances and equally stunning moral catastrophes.

† The Reformation itself was triggered by the Incident of the Three Hundred, in which three hundred prominent necromancers simultaneously realized they had perhaps been too focused on "can we" and insufficiently focused on "should we." The incident is commemorated annually with a day of contemplation, paperwork review, and wine‡.

‡ Substantial quantities of wine.

‡** The Sociological Survey of Necromantic Career Satisfaction (SSNCS) found that 73% of practitioners entered the field partly to prove something to their parents, 89% regret discussing their work at family gatherings, and 94% have practiced the phrase "it's a`,
