      "You are the kind of person who sees \"Do Not Enter\" signs as interesting suggestions rather than boundaries. Curiosity drives you with the relentless force of a very polite avalanche—unstoppable, apologetic about the destruction, already wondering what's on the other side of that mountain.",
      "Your mind collects questions the way some people collect stamps: obsessively, categorically, with a filing system that makes sense only to you. The phrase \"I wonder...\" precedes approximately 60% of your decisions, which explains both your greatest discoveries and your most regrettable incidents.",
      "You treat the unknown like an old friend who owes you explanations. Mysteries don't intimidate you; they recruit you. You're the person who sees a locked door and immediately starts wondering about hinges, keys, and whether anyone's actually checked if it's locked or just sticky."
    ],
    "high": [
      "You're curious enough to investigate but practical enough to bring rope. Adventure calls, and you answer—after checking the weather forecast and packing snacks. You like new experiences the way some people like spicy food: enthusiastically, but with awareness that sometimes you're going to regret this.",
      "Novelty intrigues you but doesn't possess you. You'll try the experimental dish, read the obscure book, take the unmarked path—just not all on the same day. Your adventurousness comes with a sensible warranty and reasonable return policy."

    "low": [
      "You believe in the wisdom of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and if it is broke, someone probably broke it by fixing it.\" Tradition persists because it works, innovation persists because people won't leave well enough alone, and you know which side of that divide you're on.",
      "The old ways have survived this long for excellent reasons, primarily that they haven't killed anyone yet. You view change with the same enthusiasm most people reserve for unexpected dental work: sometimes necessary, always unwelcome, probably going to hurt.",
      "You are traditional in the way old trees are traditional—deeply rooted, immovable, silently judging the saplings who think they know better. Progress happens around you while you remain pleasantly, stubbornly constant."

      "You treat silence like a malfunctioning appliance that needs immediate fixing, preferably with conversation. Solitude makes you nervous. Crowds make you energized. You are the person who befriends the stranger at the well, the traveler on the road, the bird that landed nearby (it's a very one-sided friendship, but you're trying).",
      "Social energy radiates from you with the intensity of a small, friendly sun. People are drawn to you, or perhaps caught in your gravitational field—the distinction isn't always clear. You collect acquaintances the way some people collect mushrooms: abundantly, indiscriminately, with genuine enthusiasm for each new specimen.",
      "You are aggressively friendly in a way that would be alarming if it weren't so sincere. Strangers become friends, friends become family, and family becomes this extensive network of people who've learned that declining your invitations only delays the inevitable. You will befriend that tree if given half a chance."

    "high": [
      "You're social but not relentless about it. You enjoy company, seek conversation, thrive in groups—but you also know when to stop talking, which puts you ahead of at least 40% of extroverts. You're the reasonable volume level in a world of people set to maximum.",
      "People energize you more than they drain you, which is fortunate because you tend to accumulate them. You're outgoing without being overwhelming, friendly without being intrusive, the social equivalent of a warm but not oppressively hot day."

    "low": [
      "You are an introvert in a world that won't stop happening at you. Social interaction isn't painful, exactly—more like wearing shoes that don't quite fit. Manageable for short periods, increasingly uncomfortable over time, absolute relief when finally removed. You've perfected the art of the Irish goodbye and feel no shame about it.",
      "Solitude isn't loneliness for you; it's reset button, the pause that makes the rest of life possible. You have a limited but renewable supply of social energy, and you guard it with the fierce protectiveness of someone who's learned what happens when the tank runs empty.",
      "You prefer your own company with the quiet certainty of someone who's spent enough time with themselves to know they're good company. Other people are fine in small doses, like garlic or philosophy. Too much at once and you need to lie down in a dark room for several hours.",
      "Crowds make you tired in ways that have nothing to do with physical exertion. It's more like your soul needs to process too many inputs simultaneously and starts filing error reports. You function best at a population density of approximately one (you), with occasional guest appearances by people you actually like."

      "You help people with the reflexive automaticity of breathing. Someone needs something? You're already moving. Someone's struggling? You're already there. You've never quite learned where you end and other people's problems begin, which makes you beloved and occasionally exhausted.",
      "Compassion arrives in you unbidden, unwanted (sometimes), unavoidable. You can't not help the way some people can't not correct grammar. It's a compulsion, possibly a design flaw, definitely inconvenient, absolutely who you are.",
      "You are kind in the specific way of people who've decided that if the universe is going to be harsh, someone has to compensate. That someone, apparently, is you. You didn't volunteer for this role but you've accepted it with the resignation of someone who knows their nature and has stopped fighting it."

      "Helping others comes naturally to you, like a well-worn path you've walked enough times that your feet find it automatically. You're generous without being a martyr about it, supportive without needing to save everyone."

    "low": [
      "You prefer your own goals with the serene indifference of a cat. Other people's emergencies have a curious way of not being yours. This isn't cruelty—you're perfectly pleasant when it suits you—it's clarity about where your responsibilities end and other people's begin. That line is very clear to you. Very far from other people.",
      "Cooperation requires a compelling reason, preferably one that benefits you directly. You're not antisocial so much as... asocial? Independent? Possibly just honest about the fact that most people's problems are, technically, their problems. You have your own to manage.",
      "You've mastered the art of being politely unhelpful. Not rude, just... unavailable. Busy. Elsewhere. Deeply invested in literally anything that isn't someone else's crisis. You're very good at this. You've had practice."

      "You are hardworking in the concerning way of people who've confused \"busy\" with \"valuable.\" If you're not actively doing something, you're planning the next thing, and if you're not planning, you're feeling vaguely guilty about it. Relaxation is theoretical concept you understand intellectually but can't actually implement.",
      "Dedication drives you with the force of a runaway cart on a steep hill—fast, focused, probably going to crash if you don't figure out how to stop, but stopping doesn't occur to you as an option. You'll rest when you're done. You're never done."
    ],

      "You're reliably hardworking without being neurotically so. Tasks get done, responsibilities get handled, but you also know how to stop when the day ends. You're productive, not possessed.",

      "You take life easy with the practiced nonchalance of someone who's figured out that tomorrow arrives regardless of today's productivity. Work will wait. It always does. Meanwhile, this patch of sunlight won't be here forever, and you have priorities.",
      "You subscribe to the philosophy that most work expands to fill available time, so why provide it with more time than absolutely necessary? Tasks get done—eventually, mostly—but never when they could be postponed for more pleasant activities.",
      "Relaxation isn't laziness to you; it's a life skill you've honed to an art form. You can find the path of least resistance in any situation, and you're not ashamed of it. Efficiency isn't about working hard; it's about working smart enough that you don't have to work hard."

      "You have the peculiar gift of making people feel both seen and useful, which is apparently rarer than it should be. You notice skills, spot potential, remember that Mara's good with animals and Jorin knows soil. Leadership arrives not from authority but from actually paying attention."

    "high": [
      "You lead when leadership's needed but don't need to lead to feel valuable. Initiative comes naturally; authority doesn't interest you unless it's useful. You're comfortable organizing, directing, coordinating—just not obsessed with it.",

      "Initiative belongs to other people as far as you're concerned. You're perfectly capable—you just don't need to be in charge to feel capable. Following well-thought-out directions is its own kind of skill, and you're very good at it."

You approach problems sideways, upside-down, from angles that shouldn't work but somehow do. Conventional solutions bore you. Unconventional solutions excite you, occasionally alarm others, frequently work anyway.",
      "Innovation flows from you with the chaotic energy of a stream that's decided \"downhill\" is more of a suggestion than a rule. You see possibilities where others see constraints, solutions where others see limitations, and occasionally problems where others see solutions, but that's creativity for you."
    ],

      "You prefer proven methods with the sensible reasoning of someone who's watched innovation fail spectacularly. Creativity is fine for people who enjoy uncertainty. You enjoy things working. The old ways work. Why mess with them?",

    "high": [
      "You feel things with the intensity of someone whose emotional volume knob is stuck at maximum. Small setbacks hit hard. Criticism lingers. Worry arrives early and stays late. This sensitivity is both your burden and your gift—you notice what others miss, care what others ignore, feel what others suppress.",
      "Anxiety is your constant companion, sometimes helpful (when it prevents disasters), often not (when it invents disasters that don't exist). You've learned to function with this background hum of concern, though \"learned to function\" might be overstating it. You're trying."

    "low": [
      "You're resilient in the way granite is resilient: unbothered, unshaken, unmoved by things that would crack other people. Stress rolls off you like water off stone. Setbacks are temporary. Criticism is data. You're impressively stable, which other people find either admirable or slightly concerning.",
      "Emotional equilibrium comes naturally to you. Not because you don't feel things, but because feelings don't destabilize you. You experience emotions and then continue functioning, a skill that seems more common than it is."

    "moderate": "You suspect there's more to the world than what you can touch, though you're not quite sure what to do with that suspicion. Faith arrives in flashes—during storms, or births, or when the dice fall impossibly wrong. The rest of the time, you're content with mystery.",
    "low": "You are, by temperament, a skeptic. The gods might exist, or might not, but either way they seem to prefer keeping their intervention ambiguous enough that a rational explanation remains possible. This suits you fine."
