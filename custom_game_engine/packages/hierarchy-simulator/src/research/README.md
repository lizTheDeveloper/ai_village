# Megastructure-Scale Research System

## Gardenings at Civilization Scale

Research at the megastructure tier is **gardening with universities**. You don't hire scientists - you create the conditions for them to emerge statistically over decades and centuries.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Individual Scale (ECS Game)
- Plant seeds → Tend crops → Harvest in days/weeks
- Build university → Fund research → See first papers in months

### City Scale (Subtier)
- Manage multiple universities → Coordinate research → Breakthroughs in years
- Learn research mechanics, tech trees, specialist recruitment

### Megastructure Scale (This System)
- Plant 100+ universities across gigasegment → Maintain stability for centuries → Tier-100 scientists emerge
- **You are gardening a civilization**

## The Statistical Emergence Model

### Tier-100 Physicist Requirements

```typescript
Conditions needed (example):
- Population: 1 trillion (1000 billion)
- Universities: 100+ tier-8+ physics universities
- Guilds: 30+ tier-8+ physics guilds
- Stability: 200+ consecutive years at 80%+
- Research: Active tier-9+ physics papers
- Legacy: 1000+ published physics papers

Base emergence rate: Once per 100 million years
With ideal conditions: Once per 4-16 million years
With perfect setup: Once per 1 million years

In-game time: 2000 hours = centuries of simulated time
Result: Tier-100 scientists are **achievable but rare**
```

### The Gardening Process

1. **Plant** (Early Game)
   - Build tier-1 universities in your gigasegment
   - Start research on tier-1 papers (simple, 1-10 year projects)
   - Establish physics/chemistry guilds

2. **Water** (Mid Game, Years 50-200)
   - Maintain >80% stability
   - Continuously fund universities
   - Publish papers to build legacy
   - Upgrade universities to tier-5+
   - Expand guild networks

3. **Tend** (Late Game, Years 200-1000)
   - Prevent collapse during crises
   - Coordinate 10+ tier-8 universities
   - Keep them geographically close (same gigasegment)
   - Avoid wars, pandemics, infrastructure collapse
   - Build research momentum (tier-7+ papers)

4. **Harvest** (Endgame, Years 1000+)
   - Tier-90+ scientists begin emerging
   - Assign them to tier-9+ transcendent papers
   - Wait for tier-100 scientists (10,000 needed for tier-10 paper)
   - Complete civilization-defining research
   - **Unlock new physics that changes the game**

| 10 | 3000-5000 | 10,000 tier-100 | "Unified Theory of Reality Manipulation" |

## The Problem-Solving Gameplay

### Example Crisis: "Can We Get 10,000 Tier-100 Physicists?"

**Year 500**: You want to research "Unified Theory of Reality Manipulation" (tier-10)
- **Problem**: Need 10,000 tier-100 physicists
- **Current state**: 2 tier-100 physicists in your gigasegment
- **Analysis**: Not even close

**Strategic Questions**:
1. How many tier-8 physics universities do we need?
   - Current: 5
   - Required: 100+
   - **Action**: Massive university expansion campaign

2. Can we maintain stability for 500 years?
   - Current: 200 years of 75% stability (below threshold)
   - Required: 500+ years of 80%+ stability
   - **Problem**: Civil unrest events, wars, resource crises

3. Are our universities in the same gigasegment?
   - Current: Spread across 3 gigasegments
   - Required: All within 1 gigasegment (collaboration requires proximity)
   - **Action**: Relocate or build new universities

4. Do we have enough physics guilds?
   - Current: 5 tier-6 guilds
   - Required: 30+ tier-8 guilds
   - **Action**: Guild development program, merge smaller guilds

**Year 600**: First wave of infrastructure
- Built 50 new tier-5 universities (cost: massive resources)
- Upgraded 20 existing universities to tier-7
- Formed 15 new physics guilds
- **Result**: Tier-90 scientists start appearing (1-2 per decade)

**Year 800**: The stability crisis
- Cultural conflict between gigasegments
- Stability drops to 40%
- Universities start collapsing, scientists emigrating
- **Consequence**: Lost 200 years of progress, emergence rate plummets
- **Recovery**: 100 years to restore stability, rebuild universities

**Year 1200**: Critical mass approaching
- 80 tier-8 universities operational
- 500 years of sustained 85% stability
- 5000 published papers creating strong research culture
- **Result**: Tier-95 scientists emerging regularly
- **Status**: Still need more for tier-100 emergence

**Year 1800**: The convergence
- 120 tier-8+ universities
- 1000 years of stability
- Active tier-9 research (drawing talent)
- **Result**: Tier-100 scientists start emerging at ~50 per century
- **Problem**: Need to sustain this for 200 more years to reach 10,000

**Year 2100**: Success or failure?
- If you maintained everything: 10,000 tier-100 physicists assembled
- If crisis hit: Back to year 1500 equivalent, try again
- **The gardening paid off** - or didn't

## Integration with Megastructure Management

Research ties into everything:

**Energy Crisis?**
- Tier-7 "Zero-Point Energy Extraction" solves it
- Requires: 200 years of research, 500 tier-80 physicists
- Do you have them? Can you sustain funding during crises?

**Cultural Conflict?**
- Tier-6 "Memetic Evolution and Cultural Convergence" helps
- Requires: Cross-disciplinary (cultural + consciousness studies)
- Need universities in both fields, same location

**Population Limit Hit?**
- Tier-8 "Hyperspatial Navigation for Dimensional Folding"
- Unlocks: Pocket dimension expansion
- Requires: Centuries of dimensional engineering research

## Victory Conditions

Tier-10 papers are **win conditions**:

- "Unified Theory of Reality Manipulation" → You can modify physical laws
- "Transcendent Consciousness Integration" → Civilization-wide collective mind
- "Temporal Paradox Resolution Framework" → Time travel unlocked
- "Hyperdimensional Substrate Transfer" → Upload civilization to higher dimensions

Each requires:
- 3000-5000 years of preparation
- Perfect execution
- No major crises
- **The ultimate gardening challenge**

## Summary

**You are not a research manager.**
**You are a gardener of civilizations.**

Plant universities.
Water with funding.
Tend stability.
Wait for rare blooms.

Some playthroughs, the garden flourishes.
Some playthroughs, droughts and storms destroy it.

That's the game.
