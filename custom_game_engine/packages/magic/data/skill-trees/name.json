  "lore": "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was Power. To know a thing's\ntrue name is to know it completely - its nature, its history, its essence.\nAnd to speak that name is to have power over it.\n\nThe art of naming is ancient and perilous. Names are not invented but discovered,\nthrough meditation, observation, and understanding. A master namer may know\nthousands of names - of stones and trees, of beasts and people, of fire and\nwind and star. Each name is a tool, a key, a weapon.\n\nBut the power of names cuts both ways. Your own true name is your deepest\nvulnerability. Guard it jealously, for anyone who knows and speaks your name\nholds power over you. Many namers go by use-names, keeping their true names\nsecret even from themselves.\n\nThe greatest namers can change names - and thereby change reality itself.\nBut this is dangerous magic. Change a name wrongly and you may unmake the\nthing entirely, reducing it to formless void.",
