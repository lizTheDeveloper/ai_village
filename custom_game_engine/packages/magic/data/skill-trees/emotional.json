  "lore": "Emotions are power. Joy, love, anger, fear - these aren't just feelings but\nforces that shape reality. A person consumed by rage can perform impossible\nfeats. A mother's love can shield her child from harm. Terror can freeze a\nwarrior in place. These aren't metaphors - they're literal truths that emotional\nmages learn to harness.\n\nThe path begins with awareness. You must learn to sense emotions in yourself and\nothers - to feel the warmth of joy, the heaviness of sorrow, the spark of anger.\nThen comes control: choosing what you feel instead of being ruled by it.\n\nWith this foundation, you can channel emotions into magic. Joy heals and creates.\nLove protects and bonds. Anger destroys. Fear paralyzes. Each emotion is a tool,\na weapon, a gift - depending on how you wield it.\n\nMore advanced techniques let you store emotions in objects, creating batteries\nof emotional power. You can project your feelings onto others, forcing them to\nfeel what you feel. You can drain emotions like a vampire, leaving others empty\nwhile you feast on their feelings. You can even transmute emotions - turning\nsorrow into joy, fear into courage.\n\nThe masters can create emotional constructs - weapons of rage-fire, shields of\nlove-light, shadows of pure terror made real. They can embody emotions completely,\nbecoming Joy incarnate or Fury made flesh.\n\nThe ultimate technique is emotion weaving - creating complex symphonies of feeling\nthat reshape reality itself. Not single emotions but intricate patterns: joy\nwoven with sorrow, love mixed with fear, courage tempered with humility. This is\nemotional magic at its peak.",
