  "lore": "Everyone is born with one Breath - the divine spark that animates life. Most\npeople live their entire lives with just that single Breath, never knowing its\npotential. But Breath can be given, taken, and used.\n\nAn Awakener learns to collect Breath from others and use it to Awaken inanimate\nobjects - giving them motion, purpose, even sentience. The process is simple in\nconcept: touch the object, visualize what you want it to do, drain color from\nnearby objects to fuel the Command, and speak the Command phrase.\n\nBut mastery takes lifetimes. Different Awakening types have different costs and\ncomplexities. Type I (simple motion) is easy. Type IV (creating Lifeless) requires\nhundreds of Breaths and perfect technique.\n\nAs you accumulate Breath, you pass through Heightenings - thresholds that grant\npassive abilities. The First Heightening (50 Breaths) gives perfect pitch. The\nFifth Heightening (2000 Breaths) grants agelessness. The Tenth Heightening\n(50,000 Breaths) allows your Awakenings to spontaneously gain sentience.\n\nThe God King himself is said to hold over 50,000 Breaths. The Returned are born\nwith thousands. Common Awakeners might have 50-500. And most people? Just the\none they were born with, given away for a handful of coins to those who would\nuse it.",
