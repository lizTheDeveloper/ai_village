  "lore": "Blood is life. This simple truth underlies all blood magic. Every drop\ncontains vitality, power, essence - the fundamental force that separates the\nliving from the dead. And what contains power can be used for power.\n\nThe path begins with self-sacrifice. Your own blood is the safest source -\nhonest magic, where your pain fuels your power. Cut your palm, speak the words,\nand reality bends to your will. It hurts, yes. It weakens you, yes. But there's\nno corruption in using what's yours.\n\nBut blood magic doesn't stop at self-sacrifice. You can use others' blood -\ngiven willingly or taken by force. You can awaken dormant bloodline powers\nsleeping in your ancestry. You can manipulate blood physically, boiling it in\nenemies' veins or shaping it into weapons. You can create blood bonds, magical\nconnections that let you share life force or even die for another.\n\nThe darkest techniques involve stealing life itself - draining vitality from\nothers to fuel your own existence, controlling people through their blood like\npuppets, or even achieving immortality through blood phylacteries.\n\nThe greatest blood mages achieve apotheosis - transforming into living blood\nitself. No fixed form, no mortal weakness, existing as pure animated life force.\nNeither alive nor dead, but eternal.\n\nBut remember: every use of blood magic leaves a mark. The more you sacrifice,\nthe more you change. And some sacrifices can never be undone.",
