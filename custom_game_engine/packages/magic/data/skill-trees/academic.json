  "lore": "Magic is a science. It has rules, formulas, principles that can be studied\nand mastered. The academic tradition treats magic as any other field of study -\nthrough education, practice, and research.\n\nYou begin with theory: understanding how magic flows, how it can be shaped, what\nfundamental principles govern its behavior. This isn't innate talent or divine\ngift - it's learned knowledge, accessible to anyone willing to study.\n\nNext comes practical application: your first cantrip, a simple spell that proves\nyou understand the basics. From there, you expand: learning more spells, building\na spellbook, mastering different schools of magic.\n\nMana is your fuel - internal magical energy that every living thing possesses.\nYou learn to sense it, conserve it, regenerate it faster. Better mana management\nmeans more spells cast before exhaustion.\n\nThe schools of magic represent different approaches and effects:\n- Evocation creates energy (fireballs, lightning)\n- Illusion deceives perception (invisibility, disguises)\n- Transmutation changes matter (polymorph, enhancement)\n- Abjuration protects and wards (shields, counterspells)\n- And more...\n\nAdvanced techniques involve spell preparation (doing the complex work in advance)\nand metamagic (modifying spells to be faster, stronger, subtler). The greatest\nwizards can research entirely new spells, inventing original magic.\n\nThe path culminates in Archmage status - recognition as one of the greatest\nmagical scholars of your age. This isn't about raw power but deep understanding\nand contribution to magical knowledge.\n\nThe academic path is methodical, intellectual, and systematic. Power comes not\nfrom faith, bloodline, or sacrifice - but from study, practice, and mastery of\nfundamental principles.",
