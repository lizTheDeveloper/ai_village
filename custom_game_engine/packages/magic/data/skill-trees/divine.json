  "lore": "Divine magic is not learned but granted. It flows from the gods to their\nfaithful followers. You cannot steal it, study it, or master it through will\nalone. You can only worship, pray, and hope your deity deems you worthy.\n\nThe path begins simply: choose a deity and begin to worship. Pray regularly.\nFollow their commandments. Demonstrate devotion through action, not just words.\nOver time, if you prove faithful, you'll gain favor. And with favor comes power.\n\nDifferent deities grant different powers based on their domains. A god of life\ngrants healing and protection. A god of war grants strength and battle prowess.\nA god of knowledge grants wisdom and prophecy. Choose your deity carefully -\nyou'll be bound to their domain.\n\nAs you advance, you may be ordained as clergy - an official representative of\nyour faith. This brings formal powers: the ability to consecrate places, perform\nsacred rites, and channel divinity directly. The most devoted can achieve\ncommunion - direct conversation with their deity.\n\nThe miracles you perform aren't your power - they're your deity's power flowing\nthrough you. You're a conduit, a channel, a vessel. This means your power is\nlimited by your deity's favor. Displease them and you lose everything. Remain\nfaithful and you gain access to truly miraculous abilities.\n\nThe greatest clerics can create relics - permanent vessels of divine power. They\ncan call for divine intervention in moments of need. The most favored can even\nserve as avatars - allowing their deity to manifest directly through their body.\n\nThis is not a path of personal power but of service and devotion. You grow\nstrong not through mastery but through faith.",
