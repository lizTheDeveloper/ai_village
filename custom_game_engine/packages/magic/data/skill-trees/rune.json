  "lore": "Runes are the written language of magic itself. Each symbol is a word of\npower, a command to reality. Carved correctly, runes can protect, strengthen,\nbind, destroy, or reshape the world.\n\nThe tradition is ancient - older than most civilizations. The first runes were\ncarved by gods or titans (depending on which stories you believe), symbols of\nprimal forces etched into the bones of the world. Later, mortals learned to\ncopy these symbols, to carve them into wood and stone and metal.\n\nLearning runecraft begins with reading - understanding what each symbol means,\nwhat it does, how it functions. Then comes carving: the meticulous, precise work\nof inscribing runes into various materials. Every line must be perfect. Every\nangle exact. A wrongly carved rune is worse than useless - it can explode,\nbackfire, or summon things best left alone.\n\nDifferent materials have different properties. Wood is easy but temporary. Stone\nis permanent but hard. Metal conducts power well. Crystal amplifies effects but\nshatters easily. Even living flesh can bear runes - tattoos of power that bond\nwith the bearer.\n\nMaster carvers learn to combine runes into sequences - each feeding into the\nnext, creating cascading effects impossible with single runes. They discover the\nElder Runes - ancient symbols of reality-bending power. The greatest even learn\nto draw living runes in air and light, inscriptions that exist for mere moments\nbut activate instantly.\n\nThe path of runecraft is one of patience, precision, and scholarship. It's less\nabout raw power and more about careful, methodical application of ancient\nknowledge.",
