Those who learn\nto hear this music can add their voices to it, shaping reality through\nresonance and melody.\n\nSong magic requires no arcane words or complex gestures - only voice, breath,\nand the will to harmonize. It is perhaps the most natural of all magics,\naccessible to anyone who can carry a tune. But mastery requires more than\ntalent: it requires understanding harmony and discord, learning the ancient\nsongs, and sometimes, singing together with others.\n\nThe greatest song mages can hear the World Song itself - the fundamental music\nof creation. To sing along with that song is to touch the divine.",
