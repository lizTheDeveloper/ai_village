# Species Architecture Design Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the architectural philosophies, materials, and characteristics of each species supported by the Building Generator Service.

## Species Profiles

### 1. Elven Architecture

**Philosophy**: Harmony with nature, flowing organic forms, minimal environmental impact

**Core Principles**:
- Buildings grow with and around living trees
- Structures enhance rather than replace natural features
- Flowing curves and organic shapes preferred over straight lines
- Natural lighting through crystals and skylights
- Timeless elegance and longevity

**Signature Materials**:
- **living_wood**: Trees shaped and grown into structure
- **crystal**: For windows, skylights, natural lighting
- **moonlight**: Crystallized moonbeams for ethereal glow
- **vines**: Living connections and decorative elements
- **enchanted_wood**: Magically reinforced timber
- **silver**: Accent material for fixtures
- **glass**: Transparent walls for forest views

**Architectural Features**:
- Curved walls following tree trunks
- Spiral staircases around ancient trees
- Canopy platforms connected by vine bridges
- Crystal skylights capturing moonlight
- Minimal foundation - buildings "float" on roots
- Carved leaves and nature motifs
- Secret passages behind living walls

**Typical Building Types**:
- Moonlit treehouses (residential)
- Crystal meditation bowers (spiritual)
- Living wood libraries (academic)
- Enchanted forges (production)

### 2. Centaur Architecture

**Philosophy**: Form follows function for equine movement, emphasis on accessibility

**Core Principles**:
- Wide open spaces for quadrupedal movement
- Ramps instead of stairs for vertical access
- High ceilings allowing rearing up
- No traditional doors (wide openings)
- Durable construction for heavy inhabitants
- Natural ventilation for active lifestyle

**Signature Materials**:
- **stone**: Sturdy foundations and load-bearing walls
- **wood**: Beams and structural support
- **thatch**: Traditional roofing material
- **clay**: Walls, flooring, ceramic elements
- **bronze**: Fixtures, tools, decorative elements
- **leather**: Weather barriers, tent-like coverings

**Architectural Features**:
- Wide doorways (8-12 feet) with no actual doors
- Gentle ramps (1:12 slope) for multi-level access
- Open floor plans with minimal internal walls
- High ceilings (15-20 feet) in main areas
- Reinforced flooring for heavy loads
- Communal spaces larger than private ones
- Storage at both ground and elevated heights

**Typical Building Types**:
- Stable dwellings (residential)
- Clan meeting halls (communal)
- Open-air smithies (production)
- Training grounds shelters (military)
- War council chambers (governance)
- Equipment storage (utility)
- Healer pavilions (medical)

**Dimensions**: Wide (20-40 feet), spacious, single-story preferred

### 3. Angelic Architecture

**Philosophy**: Vertical transcendence, divine light, sacred geometry

**Core Principles**:
- Buildings reach toward the heavens
- Sacred geometric patterns in every element
- Radiance through natural and divine light
- Radial symmetry representing perfection
- Multiple vertical levels accessed by flight
- Beauty as a form of worship

**Signature Materials**:
- **marble**: Pure white for walls and floors
- **gold**: Divine accent and structural inlays
- **crystal**: Prismatic light diffusion
- **starlight**: Captured celestial radiance
- **glass**: Transparent floors showing sky below
- **platinum**: Sacred fixtures and ornaments
- **cloud**: Solidified vapor for ethereal structures

**Architectural Features**:
- Soaring spires reaching 100+ feet
- Circular or octagonal floor plans
- Sacred geometry (golden ratio, Fibonacci spirals)
- Floating platforms connected by flight
- Radiant light sources (no shadows)
- Stained glass depicting divine scenes
- Bell towers and choir lofts
- Open-air meditation decks

**Typical Building Types**:
- Prayer spires (religious)
- Choir towers (cultural)
- Divine workshops (production)
- Celestial archives (academic)
- Meditation sanctums (spiritual)
- Healing temples (medical)
- Judgment halls (governance)

**Dimensions**: Vertical (50-200 feet tall), narrow base, expansive upper levels

### 4. High Fae (Tenth Dimensional) Architecture

**Philosophy**: Reality is merely a suggestion, space is negotiable

**Core Principles**:
- Non-euclidean geometry and impossible spaces
- Buildings exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously
- Tesseract-like spatial folding (larger inside than outside)
- Doorways connect to multiple locations
- Time flows differently in different rooms
- Architecture that shouldn't physically exist

**Signature Materials**:
- **frozen_time**: Crystallized temporal energy
- **dimensional_fabric**: Woven reality threads
- **crystallized_dreams**: Solidified imagination
- **starlight**: Stolen from distant constellations
- **moonlight**: Phases captured in crystal
- **void_matter**: Material from between dimensions
- **impossible_alloy**: Metals that contradict physics

**Architectural Features**:
- Rooms larger inside than outside (TARDIS effect)
- Stairs that loop back on themselves impossibly
- Doorways to different locations in same building
- Walls that shift between dimensions
- Floors at impossible angles (Escher-like)
- Windows showing different times of day
- Furniture that exists in superposition
- Gravity-optional rooms

**Typical Building Types**:
- Folded manors (residential)
- Impossible towers (prestige)
- Tesseract courts (governance)
- Between-space workshops (production)
- Dream archives (academic)
- Temporal sanctuaries (spiritual)
- Dimensional nexus halls (communal)

**Dimensions**: Variable and undefined, transcends 3D measurement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Elven
- ❌ Straight lines and rigid geometry
- ❌ Heavy foundations damaging roots
- ❌ Artificial lighting instead of natural
- ❌ Non-living materials dominating

### Centaur
- ❌ Normal-width doorways
- ❌ Stairs instead of ramps
- ❌ Low ceilings
- ❌ Cramped spaces

### Angelic
- ❌ Horizontal emphasis
- ❌ Dark, shadowy areas
- ❌ Asymmetric design
- ❌ Ground-level focus

### High Fae
- ❌ Normal euclidean geometry
- ❌ Physically possible architecture
- ❌ Single-dimensional existence
- ❌ Conventional spatial relationships

## Integration with Alien Worlds

When generating buildings for alien species not in the core four:

1. **Analyze species physiology**: How do they move? What size are they?
2. **Consider culture**: What do they value? What's their relationship with nature?
3. **Map to closest architectural style**: Which of the four is most similar?
4. **Adapt key principles**: Apply that style's core concepts
5. **Add unique elements**: Incorporate species-specific needs

### Example: Insectoid Species
- **Closest match**: High Fae (complex, multi-dimensional)
- **Adaptations**: Hexagonal geometry, vertical hive-like structures
- **Unique elements**: Pheromone communication channels, metamorphosis chambers
