> **Last Updated:** 2026-01-20
> **Purpose:** Player guide to the grand strategy abstraction layer

## Overview

The Grand Strategy Abstraction Layer simulates civilization progression from primitive villages through interstellar empires and beyond. As your civilization advances through 15 technology eras, new mechanics unlock at appropriate scales.

**Key Features:**
- **7-tier political hierarchy:** Village → City → Province → Nation → Empire → Federation → Galactic Council
- **15 technology eras:** Paleolithic (Era 0) to Transcendent (Era 14)
- **4-tier ship hierarchy:** Ship → Squadron → Fleet → Armada → Navy

## Ship Types & Missions

At Era 11+, specialized ship types enable unique missions.

### Standard Ships
- **Transport:** Move resources and colonists
- **Military:** Combat and defense
- **Scout:** Explore new systems

### Exotic Ships (Era 14)

#### Brainship
**Crew:** 1 (ship-brain symbiosis)
**Coherence:** Perfect (1.0)
**Role:** Solo deep-space missions

The ship's consciousness is integrated with a biological brain, enabling perfect quantum coherence for β-space navigation.

#### Probability Scout
**Crew:** 1 (solo)
**Observation Precision:** 0.9 (highest)
**Role:** Map unobserved timeline branches

**Mission Phases:**
1. **Scanning** - Locate probability branches (~50 ticks)
2. **Observing** - View branch without collapse (~100 ticks per branch)
3. **Mapping** - Compile observations (~33 ticks)
4. **Complete** - Return with timeline map

**Contamination:** Very low (0.001 per branch)
**Collapse Risk:** 1% base, reduced by precision

#### Svetz Retrieval Ship
**Crew:** Variable
**Anchoring Capacity:** Based on mass (mass/200 slots)
**Role:** Recover items from extinct timelines

Named after Larry Niven's time-traveling character, these ships perform "temporal archaeology" - retrieving items that no longer exist in the current timeline.

**Mission Phases:**
1. **Navigating** - Travel to target branch (~67 ticks)
2. **Searching** - Locate target item (~100 ticks)
3. **Retrieving** - Extract item (~50 ticks)
4. **Anchoring** - Stabilize in current timeline (~200 ticks)
5. **Returning** - Return home (~50 ticks)
6. **Complete** - Mission finished

**Contamination:** 5% per item retrieved
**Success Rate:** 70% base

#### Timeline Merger
**Crew:** Large (requires coherence)
**Role:** Merge compatible probability branches

Combines separate timelines into a unified history. High risk of paradox if branches are incompatible.

## Economic Systems

### Trade Networks
- **Shipping Lanes:** Connect cities for resource flow
- **Trade Caravans:** Move goods between settlements
- **Blockades:** Strategic chokepoint control

### Budget Allocation
- **Navy Budget:** Funds military operations
- **Maintenance Costs:** Building upkeep
- **Research Funding:** Tech progression speed

### Resource Types
- **Basic:** Food, wood, stone, iron
- **Advanced:** Steel, electronics, fusion cells
- **Exotic:** Antimatter, exotic matter, stabilized singularities

---

## Civilization Mechanics

### Uplift Diplomacy
Advanced civilizations can uplift primitive ones:

**Benefits:**
- Ally with developing civilization
- Gain diplomatic reputation
- Access unique resources

**Risks:**
- Dependency relationship
- Ethical reputation damage
- Uplift failure (civilization collapse)

**Ethics Score:** -1.0 (exploitative) to 1.0 (benevolent)

### Collapse & Dark Ages
Civilizations can collapse due to:
- Resource depletion
- War devastation
- Pandemic
- Environmental disaster

**During Collapse:**
- Technology era regresses
- Knowledge lost (unless preserved)
- Population declines
- Governance simplifies

### Knowledge Preservation
Libraries, monasteries, and universities can preserve knowledge:
- Monks/scholars maintain repositories
- Technology can be rediscovered faster
- Some knowledge survives dark ages

---

## Multiverse Mechanics

At Era 14, civilizations gain access to the multiverse.

### Timeline Forking
Major decisions create probability branches:
- **Observed events** collapse into single timeline
- **Unobserved events** remain in superposition
- **Canon events** resist change (narrative anchors)

### Cross-Timeline Travel
Ships can navigate between timelines:
- **Contamination** accumulates from cross-timeline contact
- **Paradoxes** occur when incompatible timelines interact
- **Merge compatibility** determines safe timeline merging

### Multiverse Invasion
Hostile timelines can invade:
- **Defense mobilization** via Navy
- **Diplomatic resolution** via Galactic Council
- **Timeline merger** to resolve conflict

## Megastructures

Era 12+ civilizations can build massive engineering projects.

### Dyson Swarm
- **Cost:** Enormous (planet-scale resources)
- **Time:** Centuries
- **Benefit:** Near-unlimited energy

### Wormhole Network
- **Cost:** Exotic matter
- **Benefit:** Instant interstellar travel
- **Maintenance:** Continuous stabilization

### Ringworld
- **Cost:** Asteroid belt + gas giant
- **Benefit:** Massive habitable area
- **Risk:** Structural instability

### Archaeological Sites
Ancient megastructures can be excavated:
- **Artifacts** provide technology hints
- **Reverse engineering** unlocks lost tech
- **Excavation difficulty** 1-10 scale

## Tips for Success

### Early Game (Era 0-3)
- Focus on food production and population growth
- Build basic infrastructure (roads, storage)
- Develop social structures (councils, traditions)

### Mid Game (Era 4-8)
- Establish trade networks between cities
- Balance military and economic expansion
- Manage political transitions carefully

### Late Game (Era 9-12)
- Invest in research to unlock higher eras
- Build megastructure foundations early
- Prepare for interstellar colonization

### Endgame (Era 13-14)
- Explore the multiverse cautiously
- Maintain timeline coherence
- Balance expansion with stability
