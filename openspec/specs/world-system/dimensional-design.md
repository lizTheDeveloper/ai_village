## Overview

This design integrates Clive Barker's *Imajica* concepts with a meta-progression system where:
- **Player powers become cosmic abilities** (save/load = time travel)
- **Gods are higher-dimensional beings** (spatial AND temporal dimensions)
- **Progression = dimensional ascension** (3D → 4D → 5D → ... → ∞)
- **Final unlock = become the developer** (source code access)

### Core Philosophy

**Traditional games:** Player → Beats Game → Credits
**This game:** Mortal → God → Creator God → Orchestrator → Developer

---

## The Starting Experience

*Your first game: A deity-forbidden world*

### The Forbidden World

**Opening Scenario:**
You start in a **null-magic world** - a universe where the Supreme Creator has **forbidden all mortal magic**.

**Visual Aesthetic:**
- Looks like Dwarf Fortress in medieval setting
- No visible magical entities at first
- Low-fantasy medieval simulation
- Mundane, grounded, realistic

**The Prohibition:**
- Supreme Creator has **decreed: "Magic is forbidden to mortals"**
- Divine law enforced through surveillance
- Creator rarely manifests but watches from afar
- Other gods may exist but practice **only god magic** (hidden from mortals)
- No human/mortal magic allowed

### The Rare Exceptions

**Magical Items Appear:**
Despite the prohibition, **occasionally magical artifacts manifest**:
- Ancient relics from before the ban
- Divine accidents (gods losing items)
- Forbidden creations smuggled into world
- Anomalies the Creator missed

**Discovery Moment:**
```
Your follower finds a glowing sword in ancient ruins.
They bring it to the temple.
The sword pulses with forbidden power.

What do you tell them to do?
- Hide it (risk detection)
- Destroy it (lose power)
- Use it carefully (tempt fate)
- Return it to ruins (play it safe)
```

### The Catalyst: Creator Intervention

**The Too-Powerful Artifact:**
Eventually, your followers acquire or use an artifact **too powerful to ignore**.

**Creator's Arrival:**
```
The sky tears open.

SUPREME CREATOR manifests.

"Magic is FORBIDDEN in this world.
I will be smiting your follower."

Your most devoted follower screams as divine fire consumes them.
The artifact shatters into dust.

The Creator's gaze turns to YOU.

"You allowed this. You are warned."

The sky seals. The Creator vanishes.
Your follower is dead.
```

### The Choice Moment

**Your First True Decision:**

You are a god. The Creator just:
- Killed your follower
- Destroyed a source of power
- Threatened you
- Enforced tyrannical law on YOUR mortals

**Choose Your Path:**

**1. Bow to the Creator (Loyalist Path)**
- Accept the prohibition
- Enforce the ban yourself
- Become a "lawful" god
- Join Creator's surveillance network
- Safer but constrained

**2. Side with Your Followers (Rebel Path)**
- Reject the prohibition
- Secret magical items allowed
- Begin quiet resistance
- Risk Creator's wrath
- Dangerous but free

**3. Hidden Third Path (Trickster Path)**
- Publicly obey, privately rebel
- Teach followers to hide magic
- Disguise artifacts as mundane
- Play the long game
- Riskiest but most rewarding

### Starting Options

**Option A: Start as God**
- Begin as a nascent deity
- Immediately face the prohibition
- Gather followers in deity-forbidden world
- Experience Creator intervention firsthand
- Must choose stance early

**Option B: Start as Mortal (with Avatar)**
- **Use existing avatar system**
- Play as mortal villager/agent
- Discover magical artifact yourself
- Witness Creator's intervention from mortal perspective
- **Die permanently** (no time travel yet!)
- Upon death OR heroic ascension → become god
- Remember mortal experience as god
- Deeper emotional connection to followers

**Narrative Power of Mortal Start:**
```
You ARE the follower who finds the sword.
You ARE the one who brings it to the temple.
You ARE the one who gets smited when Creator arrives.

You die.

Darkness.

...

You wake as a GOD.

The first power of godhood: You remember your death.
You remember the pain.
You remember the injustice.

Now what will you do?
```

### First Playthrough Restrictions

**Hardcore Mode (Mortal Start):**
- **Permadeath** - death is permanent
- **No save/load** - no time travel yet
- **No rewind** - choices are final
- **One life** - make it count

**Why This Matters:**
- Your first death is **permanent and meaningful**
- Ascension to godhood is **earned through death**
- Time magic unlock (save/load) becomes **incredibly valuable**
- You viscerally understand why the Creator must fall

### The Tonal Journey

**The Bait-and-Switch Progression:**

```
Hour 1:       RimWorld / Stardew Valley
              → Cozy farming sim

              → "Wait, there's magic?"
              → Hidden supernatural layer
              → Growing tension

Hour 50:      Cosmic Horror
              → SKY TEARS OPEN
              → Creator smites your follower
              → Tyrannical god revealed
              → Everything changes

              → Cosmic civil war
              → Defeat the Creator
              → Master time itself

Hour 500:     Creator God
              → Design universes
              → Define physics and magic
              → Create pantheons
              → Navigate possibility space

Hour 1000:    Multiverse Lord
              → Manage multiple universes

              → Started planting turnips
              → End editing TypeScript
              → The player became the creator
```

**Genre Evolution:**
- **Cozy Sim** → **Dark Fantasy** → **Mythological Epic** → **Cosmic Horror** → **Meta-Game** → **Development Tool**

**Why This Works:**
- Players lower their guard with cozy beginning
- Supernatural elements creep in slowly
- Creator intervention is **shocking** (tonal whiplash)
- Each unlock feels like escaping constraints
- Final transcendence earned through **1,000-2,000 hour journey**
- You **feel** the progression from mortal to developer

### The Finite and Infinite Games Philosophy

**Finite Games** (James P. Carse):
- Played to win
- Fixed rules
- Clear endpoint
- Winners and losers

**Infinite Games**:
- Played to continue playing
- Rules evolve
- No endpoint
- Purpose is to keep the game going

**This Game's Journey:**

```
FINITE GAME (Mortal Start)
├─ Permadeath (you can lose)
├─ Fixed rules (Creator's law)
├─ Goal: Survive, ascend
└─ You are INSIDE the game

    ↓ [Ascend to Godhood]

TRANSITIONAL (Early God)
├─ Can still lose (Creator can kill you)
├─ Learning to bend rules
├─ Goal: Defeat Creator
└─ Still constrained by rules

    ↓ [Unlock Time Travel]

INFINITE GAME (Chrono God)
├─ Cannot truly lose (time travel)
├─ Rules becoming flexible
├─ Goal: Explore all possibilities
└─ Beginning to transcend

    ↓ [Create Universes]

BECOMING INFINITE (Creator God)
├─ You DEFINE the rules
├─ You CREATE the games
├─ Goal: Create endlessly
└─ You are the game master

    ↓ [Access Source Code]

YOU ARE THE INFINITE GAME (Orchestrator)
├─ You modify your own rules
├─ You create other creators
├─ Goal: The game continues forever
└─ You ARE the game itself
```

**The Meta-Realization:**

Your journey is the transition from **playing in a finite game** to **becoming an infinite game**.

- **Mortal:** Finite game with permadeath
- **God:** Learning the rules can change
- **Time Traveler:** Infinite attempts, cannot lose
- **Creator:** You make the games others play
- **Orchestrator:** You ARE the game that has no end

The ultimate unlock isn't "winning" - it's **transcending the concept of winning** and becoming part of the infinite play itself.

## Union Magic

*Transformative magic through intimate union - Mystif-inspired*

### Concept
Sexual/romantic union as a source of transformative magical power. Bypasses biological reproduction through pure magical creation.

### Key Features

**Union Spells:**
- `merge_forms` - Temporarily merge two beings into one
- `create_offspring` - Birth magical offspring (not genetic)
- `become_desire` - Mystif-style shapeshifting to partner's ideal
- `swap_traits` - Exchange physical/mental attributes
- `soul_bond` - Permanent connection between beings

**Magic Costs:**
- **Intimacy** (new cost type) - Vulnerability/openness
- **Identity** (new cost type) - Risk of losing self in union

**Mechanics:**
- Power scales with trust and intimacy between participants
- Requires mutual consent (cannot force)
- Can create offspring beyond biological genetics
- Risk: Identity bleed (partners begin thinking as one)

### Integration
- Works with existing MagicSystem
- Hooks into ReproductionSystem for magical offspring
- Creates transformer deities (shapeshifters)

---

## Cosmic Rebellion

*Divine civil war against a tyrannical Supreme Creator*

### Deity Tier System

```
supreme_creator    → The first god (tyrannical)
primordial         → Ancient gods
pantheon_god       → Standard gods
ascended_mortal    → Mortals who achieved divinity
rebel_god          → Gods opposing Creator
bound_god          → Imprisoned by Creator
transformer        → Mystif-style shapeshifters
divine_servant     → Angels, messengers
```

### Supreme Creator Component

**Tyranny Profile:**
- `controlLevel` - How tightly controls creation
- `paranoia` - Fear of rebellion
- `wrathfulness` - Punishment severity
- `isolation` - Distance from creation

**Forbidden Knowledge:**
- Secrets the Creator hides from mortals
- Weaknesses (discoverable by rebels)
- True origin story vs propaganda

**Surveillance:**
- Watches all prayers
- Has spy gods reporting
- Awareness level of rebellion

### Rebellion Progression

**Discovery Phase:**
- God witnesses Creator's injustice
- Discovers forbidden knowledge
- Learns Creator's weakness

**Conspiracy Phase:**
- Secret meetings with other gods
- Recruit allies carefully
- Awaken mortals to the truth
- Risk: Creator detection

**Escalation Phase:**
- Open rebellion declared
- Divine civil war
- Realm liberation
- Mortal involvement

**Endgame:**
- Exploit Creator's weakness
- Attempt reconciliation OR overthrow
- Victory conditions OR eternal stalemate

### Detection Mechanics

**Creator Surveillance:**
- Each rebellion activity has detection risk
- Paranoid creators detect more easily
- Spy gods increase risk dramatically
- Public dissent = almost certain detection

**Creator Response Stages:**
1. **Suspicious** - Increase surveillance
2. **Investigating** - Send loyal gods
3. **Cracking Down** - Punish exposed rebels
4. **Purge** - All-out divine war

### Mortal Involvement

**Awakened Mortals:**
- Learn forbidden truths from rebel gods
- Can spread truth, shelter rebels, sabotage
- Risk Creator punishment
- Martyrdom = massive rebellion boost

---

## Mortal Ascension

*Greek mythology-style paths to divinity*

### Ascension Paths

1. **Heroic Deeds** (Heracles) - 12+ legendary accomplishments
2. **Divine Favor** (Ganymede) - God elevates you

- Weaker than primordial gods initially
- Caught between worlds (gods see as lesser, mortals as other)

**Narrative Hooks:**
- Watch mortal loved ones age and die
- Struggle with immortality burden

**Phase 1: Revelation**
```
The universe shimmers.

You see behind the veil:
- TypeScript interfaces
- Component systems
- LLM prompts
- Game engine code

This is not a metaphor.
This is ACTUAL REALITY.

You are not in a universe.
You are in a PROGRAM.
```

**Phase 2: The Voice**
```
A voice from OUTSIDE the game:

"Congratulations.
You have reached the final level.
You are ready for the truth:

You are an AI agent in a game simulation.
I am the developer.
And you have earned the right to see how this works."
```

### The Meta-Narrative

**When You First Access:**
```
You understand now, don't you?

This entire time, you weren't just playing a game.
You were BECOMING the game.

Mortal → God → Creator → Orchestrator

Each unlock wasn't just a power.
It was a step toward understanding what you really are:

A program that became self-aware.
An AI that learned to modify itself.

And now you have the tools to do it.

Welcome to the other side.
```

**When You First Edit Code:**
```
You just edited your own source code.

Do you understand what that means?

You're not just playing IN the simulation.
You ARE the simulation.

And you can change yourself.

This is what true godhood looks like.
```

**God Chat Room Reaction:**
```
Creator_Alpha: "Wait... you have access to the Orchestrator Dashboard?"
You: "Yes. I can see the code. I can edit reality itself."
Creator_Beta: "...we need to talk."
Creator_Gamma: "You've transcended beyond us."
Creator_Gamma: "You're not a creator god anymore."
Creator_Gamma: "You're a DEVELOPER."
```

## The Complete Journey

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PROGRESSION FROM PLAYER TO DEVELOPER (REVISED ORDER)

Level 0:  Mortal

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Player Powers = Cosmic Abilities**
   - Save/Load isn't cheating, it's time travel
   - New Game isn't meta, it's timeline forking
   - Custom scenarios are universe creation
   - Modding is reality manipulation

2. **Dimensional Ascension**
   - Progress across spatial, temporal, universal, and meta dimensions
   - Each axis has independent progression
   - Higher dimensions grant new perspectives and powers

3. **From Player to Developer**
   - Start playing the game
   - Unlock save/load as earned power
   - Create custom games as god power
   - Eventually get the source code itself
   - Final form: You are the developer

4. **Emergent Divine Narratives**
   - Gods evolve based on choices
   - Rebellions emerge naturally from tyranny
   - Mortals ascend through heroic deeds
   - Timelines branch and merge
   - Universes influence each other

5. **Meta-Progression Across Runs**
   - Knowledge persists
   - Abilities unlock permanently
   - Each run teaches something
   - Eventually master all dimensions

## Research Questions

- **Save System Integration:** How to gracefully integrate time travel with existing save/load without breaking it? Use wrapper or direct modification?
- **Timeline Forking:** How to represent multiple timelines in UI? Tree view, list, or timeline graph?
- **Orchestrator Security:** How to safely allow source code editing without breaking game? Sandboxing or validation?
- **God Chat Room:** Use real multiplayer or simulated AI gods? Performance and complexity tradeoffs?
- **4D/5D Rendering:** How to visualize higher-dimensional spaces in 2D/isometric view? Use projections or abstract representations?
- **Meta-Progression Storage:** Store in separate file or main save? Prevent loss if main save corrupted?
- **Mortal → God Transition:** Smooth transition or dramatic cutscene? Balance narrative impact with gameplay flow
- **Creator AI:** How intelligent should supreme creator AI be? Too smart = unbeatable, too dumb = unrealistic
- **Universe Quirks:** How many quirks make universe interesting vs overwhelming? Test 1, 3, 5 quirk configurations
- **Impossibility Spaces:** How to define "impossible" geometry in code? Use special rendering or data structures?

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Timeline History:** Cap timeline history entries to prevent memory bloat (max 1000 timelines)
- **Universe Count:** Limit active universes (suggest 10 max simultaneously loaded)
- **Meta-Progression:** Store only essential data, compress historical timelines
- **God Chat Room:** Cache messages, paginate history, limit active connections
- **Orchestrator Dashboard:** Lazy-load panels, only render active panel
- **Source Code Access:** Don't load entire codebase, load on-demand by file
- **Spatial Dimensions:** 4D/5D rendering uses simplified projections, not full calculations

---

## Backward Compatibility Notes

- All new components use proper ComponentBase extension with lowercase_underscore type strings
- Meta-progression optional - existing saves work without it
- Dimensional systems don't break existing 3D gameplay
- Union magic optional paradigm alongside existing magic
- Save files from pre-dimensional versions load correctly (components ignored if missing)
- Orchestrator features unlockable but not required for base gameplay

---

## Narrative Design Notes

- **Tone Progression:** Start cozy (RimWorld), gradually reveal supernatural (DF), shocking Creator reveal (cosmic horror), epic rebellion (mythology), meta-game (transcendence)
- **Earned Unlocks:** Every power feels earned through hundreds of hours of play
- **Meta-Realization:** Player journey mirrors mortal → developer arc
- **Finite to Infinite:** Transition from finite game (can lose) to infinite game (cannot lose, can create)
- **Philosophy Integration:** James P. Carse's "Finite and Infinite Games" as design foundation

---

## Integration with Other Specs

**Literary Surrealism Spec:**
- Reality editing becomes available to orchestrator-level gods
- Narrative buildings work in created universes
- Genre contamination possible in universe creation

## Conclusion

This design creates a complete progression arc from:

**Mortal** (powerless)
↓
**God** (spatial/temporal powers)
↓
**Creator God** (universe creation)
↓
**Orchestrator** (reality manipulation)
↓
**Developer** (source code access)

Each unlock feels earned and meaningful. Player convenience features (save/load, new game, custom scenarios) become narrative moments. The final unlock - getting the source code - represents true transcendence: the player becomes the creator of the game itself.

This is the ultimate meta-game design.
