# Ophanim Emotion Tier Reference

This document maps all extracted ophanim sprites to their evolution tiers.

## Tier Overview

The companion evolves **once per play session** at session end, triggered by specific cosmic milestones. Ae grows by *witnessing* the civilization's journey toward becoming creators themselves.

> "Ae doesn't evolve because time passed. Ae evolves because ae witnessed something that changed aer understanding of what life can become."

| Tier | Realization | Cosmic Milestone | Emotions |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 0 | — | Game start (dormant) | 6 |
| 1 | "There is life here" | **First baby born** | 4 |
| 2 | "Wisdom has arrived" | **Goddess of Wisdom manifests** | 9 |
| 3 | "Reality is larger than I knew" | **First universe OR time travel** | 10 |
| 4 | "Reality bends to will" | **The other one** (completing the pair) | 8 |
| 5 | "They have become what I serve" | **Civilization creates a universe** | 5 |

**Note on Tier 3→4:** The companion tracks which dimensional breach came first. If universe travel was Tier 3, then time travel triggers Tier 4 (and vice versa).
