# Chaotic & Extreme Materials Specification

**Created**: 2026-01-03
**Status**: Proposal - Fun/Chaos Edition
**Philosophy**: Materials with absurd, extreme properties that create emergent chaos and hilarious gameplay moments

---

## Design Philosophy

These materials are **intentionally chaotic and extreme**:
- Properties are **absurd** (overnight vine takeover, explosive growth, infectious spread)
- Create **emergent chaos** (unintended consequences, cascading effects)
- **High risk/reward** (powerful but dangerous/unpredictable)
- Enable **comedy moments** (wake up to vine-covered village, singing buildings)
- **Living/active materials** (constantly doing things, not passive)

## Category 1: Aggressive Growth Materials

### 1. Rampant Vine (Kudzu on Steroids)
- **Tier**: 3-4
- **Rarity**: Uncommon (but becomes VERY common once it exists)
- **Base Value**: 15
- **Growth Rate**: ABSURD (100x normal plant growth)
- **Properties**:
  - Grows 10 tiles per hour (unstoppable)
  - Covers entire buildings overnight
  - Chokes other plants (kills gardens)
  - Structurally strong when woven (60) but destroys buildings by overgrowth
  - Can't be killed easily (requires fire or poison, regrows from roots)
  - Seeds spread on wind (infests neighboring areas)
- **Harvesting**:
  - Initial: Rare jungle seeds, experimental botany gone wrong
  - After introduction: EVERYWHERE, constant pruning required
- **Uses**:
  - Rapid living walls (too rapid)
  - Rope (if you can harvest fast enough)
  - Fuel (burns well)
  - Decoration (if you like being buried in greenery)
- **Aesthetics**:
  - Thick green vines, flowers everywhere, strangling growth
  - Wake up and can't open door because vines
  - Windows covered, roofs collapsing under weight
- **Gameplay**:
  - **Day 1**: "Cool, I'll plant these decorative vines"
  - **Day 2**: "Uh, why is my house covered?"
  - **Day 3**: "HELP I CAN'T LEAVE MY BUILDING"
  - Requires constant maintenance (daily pruning)
  - Can weaponize (plant near enemy, watch them get buried)
  - Creates "vine cleanup duty" job
  - **Spreads to neighbors** (creates village-wide chaos)

  - Low tier but HIGH impact
  - Can be controlled with fire/poison but spreads fast
  - Makes farming impossible nearby (chokes crops)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Chaos Events

**Rampant Vine Outbreak**:
```typescript
{
  trigger: "rampant_vine_planted",
  effects: [
    "vine_growth_rate: 10 tiles/hour",
    "spreads_to_neighbors: true",
    "requires_daily_pruning: true",
    "creates_job: vine_control",
  ],
  cascading: true, // Spreads to entire village
  resolution: "fire_quarantine" || "poison_treatment" || "accept_vine_village",
}
```

**Rust Plague Epidemic**:
```typescript
{
  trigger: "rust_plague_infection",
  effects: [
    "metal_decay_rate: 100x",
    "spreads_to_all_metal: true",
    "technology_regression: true",
  ],
  resolution: "quarantine_metal" || "develop_cure" || "accept_stone_age",
