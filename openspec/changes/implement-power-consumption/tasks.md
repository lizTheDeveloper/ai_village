# Tasks: Implement Power Consumption System

## Phase 1: Power Grid Architecture

- [ ] Design power grid data structure
- [ ] Design power source interface
- [ ] Design power consumer interface
- [ ] Plan power flow algorithm
- [ ] Design priority system for brownouts

## Phase 2: Power Sources

- [ ] Implement generator power production
- [ ] Add solar panel power production
- [ ] Implement fuel consumption for generators
- [ ] Add power source degradation/maintenance
- [ ] Test power generation

## Phase 3: Power Consumers

- [ ] Add power consumption to appliances
- [ ] Add power consumption to lights
- [ ] Add power consumption to machinery
- [ ] Implement device shutdown on no power
- [ ] Test power consumption

## Phase 4: Power Grid System

- [ ] Implement PowerGridSystem
- [ ] Add power flow calculation
- [ ] Implement brownout logic
- [ ] Add power distribution across grid
- [ ] Test grid with multiple sources/consumers

## Phase 5: UI & Feedback

- [ ] Add power status to building UI
- [ ] Add power grid visualization
- [ ] Add low-power warnings
- [ ] Add power management dashboard view
- [ ] Test user experience

## Validation

- [ ] Devices consume power correctly
- [ ] Generators produce power correctly
- [ ] Brownouts occur when supply < demand
- [ ] Priority system works
- [ ] All TODO comments resolved
- [ ] Power system tests pass
